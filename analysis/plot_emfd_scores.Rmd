# Average EMFD scores by inquiry

Compute average score for each moral foundation for submissions to each inquiry.
Note that we're filtering out any submission that doesn't use any moral words
at all with the `moral_nonmoral_ratio` variable - this is important because some
of the submissions have very few words, (or no words at all if they haven't been
OCR'ed yet) - if we included these we would be underestimating the score because
have a 0 default score. The Moral Foundation scores are based on the paper below
using the Extended Moral Foundations Dictionary.
