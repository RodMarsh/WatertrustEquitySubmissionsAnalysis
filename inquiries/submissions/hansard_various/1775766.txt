                      ( New South Wales —Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 09:02 ):  Back to questions I began asking yesterday, particularly on the one-off adjustments. Can the minister confirm whether the existing clause for the register of take—the working out of the register of take and the debit or credit—is currently an existing clause in the Water Act that allows for a reasonable excuse? Can the minister confirm that that reasonable excuse clause remains and will still apply to the one-off adjustments?
