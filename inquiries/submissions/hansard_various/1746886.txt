                      ( Indi ) ( 10:58 ):  I rise to acknowledge the member for Parkes and his defence of his community. I understand what he is saying. I want to be clear that we each represent our communities in policy debates in this House, and I fully respect his views. I want to be clear, though, that this amendment speaks to targeting and strategic buybacks, and it's very easy when the largest amount of water that flows through the Darling Basin comes from the electorate of Indi to simply target the southern basin. I'm simply asking of the government that they're strategic, that we stop this Swiss-cheese approach of buybacks and that we target those buybacks. In that targeting we must consider the northern basin equally, rather than go simply to the southern basin, where the majority of water is stored.
