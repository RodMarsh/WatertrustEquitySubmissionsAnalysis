                      ( Queensland â€” Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation ) ( 09:49 ):  We have 50 per cent of Australia under native title claim. And then both the government and the opposition passed the land and sea council, so basically Aboriginals have control of water above and below ground and in the Commonwealth waters. Water is essential to the farming sector. Why would you do a deal to give another $100 million of water allocation to the Aboriginal people purely to make money out of when these people don't hold land to produce food or anything else? It's purely to make money out of it at the expense of the taxpayer. I don't get it. Australians won't understand it either. There are other avenues of grants for Aboriginal people to be able to buy their own water. There are royalties and everything else that they have. Why are the taxpayers funding this again? Minister, how much of our water in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is in foreign ownership or hands?

                     Senator Dean Smith 
                     ):   Senator Hanson, would you mind repeating your question for the minister, please? 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Senator HANSON: 
                       I'd like to know how much water in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is actually owned by foreign investors.
