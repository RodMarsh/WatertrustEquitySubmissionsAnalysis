                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 12:00 ):  I don't think I'm in a position in the chamber to provide an evaluation of the specific proposal that you're speaking about. I've given the principles that the government would use in evaluating whether something was held environmental water. If I can provide additional information I will, but it sounds like you're asking me to evaluate a proposal that's before the government and is under consideration. I don't think we're in a position to provide concluded advice about that. I personally concede that I do not have detailed knowledge of the proposal.
