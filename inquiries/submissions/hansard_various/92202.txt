—Senator Bob Brown made some quite complimentary comments about Senator Siewert’s contributions, and I think they are appropriate for the work that she has done. But the submission we have just heard from Senator Bob Brown would indicate that he has not done that degree of work. I refer him to page 15 of the bill, just in case he did not get that far. It states:

 
 
 
 relevant international agreement  means the following: 
            (a)           the Ramsar Convention; 
            (b)           the Biodiversity Convention; 
 …            …            … 
            (g)           ROKAMBA 
 
 There is a long list, including the ROKAMBA convention. Further down, it states: 
 
 
 ROKAMBA  means the Agreement with the Government of the Republic of Korea on the Protection of Migratory Birds done at Canberra on 6 December 2006. 
 
 All of those matters are in the bill. 
 Question put: 
 
 That the amendments ( Senator Siewert’s ) be agreed to.
