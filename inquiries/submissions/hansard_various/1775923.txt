                      ( New South Wales — Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 11:59 ):  You asked about whether I, the minister or the government were aware of the Water Futures Efficiency Program. I am advised that the government are in receipt of this proposal—I think we would characterise it as a proposal—and they are considering it.
