                      ( Queensland â€” Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery ) ( 20:56 ):  I thank all the senators who have made a contribution to the Water Amendment (Long-term Average Sustainable Diversion Limited Adjustment) Bill 2012. It is a significant reform to the Water Act. The bill has now passed the House of Representatives and, as time is short this evening, can I just point out that the government welcomes the report from the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment and Communications on the bill and the work that the various senators have played in bringing this bill to the Senate this evening. I commend the bill to the Senate.
