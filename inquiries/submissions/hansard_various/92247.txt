â€”The honourable senator told us earlier that we do not live in a perfect world. Clearly, that is the case. We would like to think that this legislation might make it a little bit closer to being perfect. There will be, hopefully as a result of the IGA and other matters, greater consultation and information sharing, which will hopefully overcome that. But, at the end of the day, it is still largely a state jurisdictional issue.
