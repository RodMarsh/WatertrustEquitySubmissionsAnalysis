                      ( Western Australia ) ( 19:14 ):  Minister, can you confirm that in fact the co-design process will involve 44 or 40 nations of the First Nations peoples in the basin versus a national water group that in fact the minister holds as a separate governance arrangement? It's important that the agency and the department acknowledge that the input of local groups is required into this co-design process. This is not a national framework for water and First Nations water rights; this is about the Murray-Darling Basin and the impact on those 44 First Nations groups in and around the basin.
