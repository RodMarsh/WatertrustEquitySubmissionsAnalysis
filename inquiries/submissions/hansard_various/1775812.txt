                      ( New South Wales —Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 09:30 ):  While I do appreciate the minister's continued assertion that they don't want to make announcements which could impact the market, I will just note that previously both Minister Wong and Minister Burke routinely issued media releases outlining how much funding was available in total for each general tender round. They were also quite public in how much money was available deliver the Basin Plan. Now we have a government which went to the election declaring transparency and a new way of governing, but what we continue to get is silence and a refusal to at least announce the total figure available so that Australian taxpayers can understand what this reform is going to cost them. Back in 2011 we saw work done by the CSIRO, trying to assess the amenity value in undertaking this water reform. They did a big survey across the nation to understand what the value of a healthy river was to people. People said that it was invaluable until they were asked what they thought if it cost them about $20 a week, and then all of a sudden the value ratio fell. And we continue to see this government hiding what it's going to cost Australian taxpayers. 
                 
                 
                   What I'm really asking—all I'm asking—is this: has the government done the work? Has the government modelled what the cost of this reform would be to the taxpayer?
