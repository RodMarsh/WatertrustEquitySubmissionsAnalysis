—Yes, I am aware of that. Perhaps I should have indicated that in my comments. It gives more effect to the bill, compared with the other conventions it gives effect to. We are trying to give effect to the recommendations of the EDO, as the bill is silent on how the plan ought to give effect to the climate change convention. The others—which are in clause 21(2) and 21(3)—talk specifically about biodiversity and Ramsar but are silent on climate change. Is there a reason for that?
