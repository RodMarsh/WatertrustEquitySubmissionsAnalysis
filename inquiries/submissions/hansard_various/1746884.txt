                      ( Indi ) ( 11:00 ):  I've seen many disgraceful things in this parliament in the time that I've been here, so I do take objection at levelling that. I have consulted widely across my electorate and beyond. What I've asked for in this amendment is that the government consider strategic buybacks that have the best outcome for the impacts that the government are seeking to achieve. If the Leader of the Nationals were to go back and look at my speech from last night—and I encourage him to do so—he would understand that the people of Indi absolutely understand the competing interests of water. This is one of the most contested areas of public policy. What I am putting forward in this amendment is that if we are to do buybacks—and this bill is doing that—then we should do so backed by the science, and they should be done strategically so that we get the best outcomes for those buybacks.
