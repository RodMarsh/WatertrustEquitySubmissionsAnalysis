â€”I fully agree with you. If it were a perfect world there would be no need for legislation and, guess what, there would be no need for this place. That would be heaven! I dare say the senator is referring to the Gwydir situation. That is the responsibility of the New South Wales government. I confess I am not fully across all the detail of that. I know that people are, from time to time, frustrated that they provide information to relevant authorities and prosecutions do not take place or there are considerable delays before a prosecution is laid. Before making comment on that, it is necessary to be fully briefed in relation to the facts so that we can be assured that any criticism levelled is valid. I know of the Gwydir situation, courtesy of the media, but I do not have a detailed brief as to what information has been provided and whether the New South Wales authorities are pursuing it in an appropriately diligent manner. I cannot assist the senator further.
