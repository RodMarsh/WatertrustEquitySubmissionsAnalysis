                       The Liberal and National government is committed to working with the states in a bipartisan manner supporting the implementation of the plan through the recovery of water through the $1.33 billion off-farm efficiencies and $234 million for community activity, while ruling out further buybacks that cost jobs and hurt our regional basin communities. 
                 
                 
                   Question agreed to.
