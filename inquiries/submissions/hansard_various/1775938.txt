                      ( New South Wales — Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 11:45 ):  Just for clarity—and I don't assert that you are doing this deliberately, but my previous answer to the question indicated that that long list of particular delivery rights and mechanisms could be considered held environmental water; it was not in relation to leasing. The amendment that is before us right now—the government amendment that we're considering, here in Committee of the Whole—doesn't go to leasing. We understand that the Water Act already contemplates leasing, and so this amendment doesn't go to that.
