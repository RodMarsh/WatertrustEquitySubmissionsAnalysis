                      ( South Australia â€” Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate ) ( 12:03 ):  Assuming this bill goes through as it's designed, how quickly would the government be in a position to be able to provide the sector with the kind of advice around the scope of projects that would be considered? I ask this on the basis of having an innovative sector. I'm sure we will come up with some innovative responses. It would be interesting to know what sort of time frame before you can give them the certainty, because we certainly don't want them investing in things and wasting their time and effort if the government has no intention of considering them.
