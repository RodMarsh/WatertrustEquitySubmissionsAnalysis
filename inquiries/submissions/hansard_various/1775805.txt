                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:25 ):  Senator Davey, I'll see what I can provide in terms of the specific figures that you are seeking. We provide regular updates through the ordinary budget process. However, I'm advised that the particular thing that this legislation does is to unlock funding from the Water for the Environment Special Account in the order of $1.3 billion for more options.
