                      ( New South Wales — Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 10:40 ):  Thanks, Senator Pocock. Your question relates to other kinds of measures that might be undertaken by the state government or the Commonwealth government to improve the environmental health of waterways and channels within the Murray-Darling system. That isn't principally what this bill is about; this bill is about tools for water recovery to obtain environmental water. 
                 
                 
                   But of course these things are connected. Systems that have very low flows in them often see a deterioration in water quality, and systems that have very low flows in very dry periods are at risk of deterioration in quality—that can produce fish kills, for example. There are other features of water management within systems that are principally the responsibility of state governments, and those can support or impede—can prevent or catalyse—erosion, depending on the approach taken by the water authorities in the states and territories. These are all things we should be thinking about, but they're not the principal focus of the legislation.
