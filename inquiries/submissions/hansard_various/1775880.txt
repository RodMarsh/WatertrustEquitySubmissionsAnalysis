                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 10:59 ):  Senator Roberts, as I've indicated to you, I don't have that document with me for I think quite obvious reasons. I'll see what can be provided. But, as I've already said, the communique is on the website.
