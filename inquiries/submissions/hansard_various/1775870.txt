                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 10:56 ):  Just for clarity, Senator Roberts, consent isn't the terminology that we utilise. We're working with the states and territories to reach agreement about the approach. Whether or not the Commonwealth government brings legislation into the government is a matter for the Commonwealth government. It's a relevant distinction. The evidence I provided to Senator Hanson was about the agreement that we had reached with the basin states that I have just named.
