—I will just respond to the member for Grayndler’s comments about risk assignment. He has expressed a concern that the Commonwealth has withdrawn its undertaking to assume the states’ responsibilities for liabilities from allocations reduced by reason of changes in knowledge. The offer to take on those responsibilities was always on the basis of a full referral of powers from all basin states. That was always the context in which it was made. It was made because under what we could call the comprehensive water bill, which would have been based on referrals from four states, the Commonwealth would have had a very high degree of control and management over the waters of the basin. Under this legislation, while it is an enormous step forward and achieves much of what had been contemplated under the comprehensive bill, it does not go that far. Until the Commonwealth has full control, it is not reasonable that it would have a full liability. But once all four states have referred their powers then that commitment will be fulfilled.

 
 Question agreed to. 
 Bill, as amended, agreed to.
