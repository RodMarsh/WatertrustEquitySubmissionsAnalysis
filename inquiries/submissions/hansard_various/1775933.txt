                      ( New South Wales â€”Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 12:12 ):  Would there be scope for a proponent to consider how a model may be proposed to the government? This does not require the government to accept any proposal nor does it necessarily mean the government will go out with some sort of a program to that end but it opens the door for conversations to be held about what a model might look like that will not then have to come before us for legislative change.
