                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:48 ):  Thanks, Senator Hanson. Yes, the minister has announced that the Labor government has increased the financial commitment to First Nations water ownership from $40 million to $100 million. This is in recognition of the delays since the original funding was announced by the previous government in 2018. Those delays have caused a significant erosion in the value of that investment. We expect purchasing towards this to commence early next year. We continue to work closely with First Nations people on the basin and on the design and delivery of this program, including on the enduring water-holding mechanism.
