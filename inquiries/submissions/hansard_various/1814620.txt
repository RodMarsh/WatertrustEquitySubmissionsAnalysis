                    ( 09:29 ):  In accordance with the orders just agreed, the time for consideration of the Water Amendment (Restoring Our Rivers) Bill 2023 has expired. I will now put the questions required to conclude consideration of the bill. I will first deal with the government amendments on sheet ZC243 revised moved by Senator McAllister. Senator Thorpe has circulated amendments to government amendment (1). The question is that Senator Thorpe's amendments on sheet 2267 to government amendment (1) be agreed to.

                 (f) determine and develop priorities and strategies for the use of Basin water resources to which Basin Indigenous Peoples have a traditional connection. 
               
               
                 (3) Amendment (1), item 1B, paragraph 20(da), omit the paragraph, substitute:
