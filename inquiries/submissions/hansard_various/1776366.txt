                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 19:13 ):  Thank you Senator Cox. I believe I have been asked about this previously in estimates, possibly by you! We are presently exploring the governance arrangements that could be put in place. We are conscious of the significance of having First Nations people directly involved in the governance of any water acquired through the program. This is a process of co-design and it has not been finalised, but we are open to arrangements that support engagement by First Nations people in the management of these assets which are being provided for through the program.
