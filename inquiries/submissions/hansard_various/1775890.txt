                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 11:03 ):  The implementation arrangements for water recovery are yet to be finalised. What this bill does is to set out additional options for water recovery, including a wider range of infrastructure projects that might be funded or utilised and voluntary buybacks, which is the question that you are asking now. The government understand that we require a wider range of policy instruments to implement the plan. The advice to us is that, in the absence of a wider range of instruments and options, we won't be able to meet the plan's goals and targets. It's on that basis that we're bringing forward the legislation. But the specific ways in which we will approach voluntary water buybacks have not yet been finalised.
