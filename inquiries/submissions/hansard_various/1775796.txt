                      ( New South Wales â€”Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 09:05 ):  I love a simple answer. That makes things very easy. The amendments appear to add to the Basin Plan. The existing methodology for the register of take is in the Basin Plan. It would appear that these amendments mirror that methodology for the one-off adjustment. It's unclear why a one-off adjustment would be required, given that debits and credits are cumulative. But am I right to say that, under the existing plan, the register of take is set to zero on the accreditation of water resource plans, and what this adjustment will allow is for it to have been set to zero in 2019, at the same time as the original Basin Plan intended, and to use the methodology to estimate what it would have been, given there were no water resource plans existing? So this will only apply to areas where water resource plans weren't in effect in 2019?
