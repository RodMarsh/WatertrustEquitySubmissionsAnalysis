                      ( Queensland â€” Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation ) ( 09:59 ):  So the federal government has spent $2.8 billion over the period of time, but you didn't allocate the licences; the states did. The states are still allocating licences. Why haven't you reined in the states to stop them allocating licences? They're actually selling the licences, making money out of it, and the Commonwealth is actually buying the water allocations back. I'm sorry, but it doesn't make sense to me.
