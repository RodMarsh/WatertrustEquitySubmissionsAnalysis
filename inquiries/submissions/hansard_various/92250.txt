—There is just a difference in emphasis. Clause 172(1)(c) does not address the need to draw the authority’s attention to its function to ensure measuring and monitoring and therefore provide against threats to the long-term health of the river and its ecosystem. That is not there; it is not going to be there. We want it there.
