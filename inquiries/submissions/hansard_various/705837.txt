                      ( Victoria â€” Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations ) ( 19:00 ):  I seek leave to make a brief statement. 
                 
                 
                   
                     The PRESIDENT:   Leave is granted for one minute. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Senator JACINTA COLLINS: 
                       It seems that today is a day for a couple of inadvertent responses to circumstances. It has become apparent to me that, in the debate on the disallowance motion, there was not an opportunity for a member of the Liberal Party to make a contribution. Senator Birmingham was the next on the list. During these votes we agreed that Senator Birmingham would be able to speak up until 7.20 pm.
