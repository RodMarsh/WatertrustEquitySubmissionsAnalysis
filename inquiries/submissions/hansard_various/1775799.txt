                      ( New South Wales â€”Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 09:26 ):  The original Water for the Environment Special Account had $2 billion, if my memory serves me correctly. I think $200 million was set aside for easing constraints, so that left $1.7 billion. If there's $1.3 billion remaining that this legislation unlocks for other purposes and if that funding is found not to be enough to meet the target of 450 gigalitres of water recovery through the range of options that this bill will unlock, will that funding be supplemented?
