                      ( New South Wales â€”Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 09:20 ):  So we're going to keep doing what we're doing, but we're going to say we're doing it better. That's essentially what I hear in that. I also want to come back to the fact that this bill is before us without a regulatory impact statement, and we are advised that there will not be a regulatory impact statement provided. Given that, and following on from Senator Lambie's question to you yesterday, I want to understand what work has been done to estimate the socioeconomic impacts of this bill and the cost of delivering this bill to the Australian taxpayers.
