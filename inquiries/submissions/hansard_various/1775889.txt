                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 11:05 ):  Thanks, Senator Roberts. I provided information about this in response to similar questions from Senator Davey earlier in the debate. There is provision in the Commonwealth budget for voluntary water purchase. The relevant amounts are not for publication, and the reasoning for withholding those amounts from publication is the capacity for publication to impact on the market overall and also the need to preserve the Commonwealth's negotiating position to ensure we are able to obtain value for money for taxpayers should we make purchases.
