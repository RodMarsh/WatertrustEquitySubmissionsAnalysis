                      ( South Australia ) ( 10:18 ):  I have questions for the minister on the government's amendment sheet ZC243, which, I understand, is the one before us now. There are a number of elements to this. We've talked about the changes to the register of take, which are obviously important. I would also like the government to expand on the changes to the objects in the act, given that they are a fundamental part of the agreement with the Australian Greens for support in this bill. I'd also like the minister to outline the other integrity measures that the government has agreed to undertake in relation to getting the Greens' support and allowing us to strengthen this bill and to outline the complementary measures to this bill.
