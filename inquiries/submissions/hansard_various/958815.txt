                     Senator DUNIAM: 
                     The Morrison-McCormack government is committed to the Basin Plan. The government have done the heavy lifting and we've recovered 98 per cent of the water required to meet the SDLs. The reports identified that it is basin communities that have borne the brunt of this achievement. They clearly show that a flexible approach is needed to continue progress. That is why we have committed to no more buybacks from farmers. We are unashamedly committed to basin communities and the irrigated agriculture that supports them. Our policies, including the $270 million Murray-Darling Communities Investment Package, are focused on delivery.
