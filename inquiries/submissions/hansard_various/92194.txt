—I thank the minister for that answer. As I said, I understand the arguments that were being put, but we were keen to ensure that the plan was done within two years. As I said earlier, the Greens are concerned about the time delays that are built into this process, so we want to make sure that that is underway. Minister, could you also give us clarification of the time line involved in the IGA? I appreciate that that is not entirely under your purview—there is a negotiation process—but what is the time frame the government would ideally like to work towards?
