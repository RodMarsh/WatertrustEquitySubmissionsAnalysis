                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:10 ):  I think you are quite capable of telling your own story about the role of the Greens political party in Australian politics. But you are quite correct that this is one of the many matters that the government has been happy to discuss with the crossbench and, in particular, with your party. We agree that integrity in the plan and in the implementation of the plan is important. As I have previously explained to the chamber, this amendment seeks to provide equity and fairness for all basin states.
