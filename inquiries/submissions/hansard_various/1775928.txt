                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 12:04 ):  The advice to me is that, should the bill pass, the department will immediately begin working through some of the options that are before the department and working with proponents and engaging with communities more generally about other ideas they may wish to bring forward.
