                      ( South Australia ) ( 09:08 ):  In relation to these government amendments and, in particular, this amendment that Senator Davey is asking about, I want to clarify that this is an amendment that the Greens negotiated with the government specifically for our support for this bill. That is because we have seen, consistently for years now, the system being gamed. The longer you hold out, the more water you can suck while everybody else is doing the heavy lifting. New South Wales, in particular, has gamed the system. It's time that that stopped. If we want to reinstate integrity, trust and accountability into this system, we need this measure in place. I want confirmation from the government that this is something that we fought hard for.
