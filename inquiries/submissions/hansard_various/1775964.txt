                      ( Queensland ) ( 12:14 ):  Minister, you mentioned that 16 per cent of water has been recovered under coalition governments and that means 84 per cent have been recovered under Labor or Labor-Greens coalitions. The late John Bristow said in 2007 that Australia had a wonderful water management, probably the best in the world. Then John Howard and Malcolm Turnbull as minister introduced the Water Act in 2007. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission, which had been working productively with the states, was changed to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. Four years later, under Labor and Labor-Greens governments, Bristow said Australia had fallen to the world's worst water management. 
                 
                 
                   Science and everyday observation contradict the Murray-Darling Basin Plan's basis, and this bill's basis. When will you do a review of the Murray-Darling Basin's core foundation, its impacts and its environmental, socioeconomic and economic destruction based on data?
