                      ( Queensland ) ( 11:13 ):  Minister, we find two points of agreement. You said, 'We can't go on like we are,' and by that you are confirming, if not intentionally then inadvertently, the lack of measurement of water flows across the basin is hurting. You also said the volume of water does matter. It's exactly why I need measurements. As we know, Minister Plibersek could go down as the minister who choked the Barmah Choke, because we see the environmental damage of collapsing banks right across Victoria and southern New South Wales—right across the Murray River, sorry, and parts of the Murrumbidgee. We see riverbanks, siltation of the river—we see the Barmah Choke, which is critical, being choked. The capacity has gone from 10,000 to 7,000. We see environmental damage. We see overwatering of forests. We see black water. 
                 
                 
                   You said the heart of the problem is that we can't go on like we are. Heart deals with emotion. I want the data. My question to you was: 'Without data there can be no plan. Why do you call this a plan? Is that misinformation?' There is a lack of data on which to allocate water.
