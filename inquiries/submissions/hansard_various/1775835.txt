                      ( New South Wales — Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:58 ):  I'm just looking at a table on the website, which you may wish to consult at some point too. If you check the website of the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, there is a page titled 'Table of water reform funding in the Murray-Darling Basin', and it says: 
                 
                 
                   Since 2007, The Australian Government has committed $13,293 million to implement water reform in the Murray-Darling Basin. Funding is split between these 4 broad areas: 
                 
                 
                   Infrastructure—physical upgrades to water infrastructure 
                 
                 
                   Purchase—purchase of water entitlements 
                 
                 
                   Environment—projects to support our environment 
                 
                 
                   Community, industry and other—programs to help communities and industry, as well as other activities. 
                 
                 
                   In the section on purchase, it indicates that the total funds spent on water purchase is roughly $2.8 billion.
