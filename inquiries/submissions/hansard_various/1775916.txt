                      ( South Australia — Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate ) ( 11:27 ):  On the back of your previous few answers, can I assume that the government has no idea about the likely impact on river communities of taking significant amounts of water out through buybacks—which, of course, means they can completely circumvent any need to avoid socioeconomic impact on river communities—and that the government actually does not understand, in any quantum, the kind of impact that is likely to occur to river communities?
