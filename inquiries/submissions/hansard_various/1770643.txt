                    ( Mallee ) ( 13:57 ):  Last week the Albanese Labor government was forced to face reality and admit that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan could not be delivered on time. It has been plainly obvious that the time frames were unrealistic and that the minister and member for Sydney has failed to garner cooperation from the states to deliver their sustainable diversion limit projects. Her stated preference is to go to buybacks. Let me be clear: there is no way that the Nationals will support buybacks to meet environmental targets. That is why we implemented the socioeconomic neutrality test in 2018. The 450 gigalitres sought through buybacks will never be supported by us, because we know it will decimate regional irrigation districts, like Sunraysia, in my electorate of Mallee. The neutrality test must be honoured for the sake of our river communities and the prosperity of the nation. 
               
               
                 The latest Centre for International Economics  C ontribution of Australian hort i cultural industry  report lists the Mildura and Swan Hill region in Sunraysia as Australia's most valuable horticultural region. Its gross value of production is expected to grow by 32 per cent in the next seven years. The Albanese Labor government simply cannot compromise this growth through buybacks. The result would be devastating. I urge the minister to reconsider and refuse any buybacks on principle.
