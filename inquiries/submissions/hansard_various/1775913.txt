                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 11:07 ):  Senator Roberts, I'm not going to be too dismissive about this, but, seriously, you would be the first person to ask that the government take the time to work across the chamber to find agreement on legislation of national significance. It is not at all surprising that we have consulted with those senators who have reached out to us in good faith seeking to bring their own perspectives and experiences, and the priorities of the communities with whom they have the closest and strongest relationships, to bear on the bill. We are always willing to work with senators across the chamber to improve legislation. That has been the approach that the government has taken. Ministerial portfolios will continue to be allocated in the ordinary way.
