                      ( New South Wales â€”Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 09:24 ):  I completely understand the market implications. Following a Senate estimates, I think it was inadvertently announced by the department that they would be buying 46 gigalitres of water, and there were immediate market impacts, even though it was months before the tender process commenced. I understand why the minister won't make announcements about market operations, but I think it is fair that the Australian public understand how much the total quantum of this continued water reform would be, how much funding is available through existing pools and how much new funding may be required to finalise the Basin Plan. Can the minister take us through the funding that is left in existing pools, including how much is left available in the Water for the Environment Special Account, how much is left in the efficiency measures funding bucket, the constraints easing funding program and the Bridging the Gap funding?
