                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 10:23 ):  I was answering questions from Senator McKenzie earlier. She raised to make a point of order, and then we seemed to move on. I'm quite happy to re-engage with Senator McKenzie on this set of issues. As I've said, this bill seeks to create a range of new capacities that will allow government to implement the plan. That is something that the government that you were part of, Senator McKenzie, comprehensively failed to do. When we came to office the advice we received was that this plan could not be implemented on time under the current policy settings. We have undertaken the work necessary to get the plan back on track. 
                 
                 
                   I have indicated to you that the arrangements by which we would utilise the tools that will be established should this legislation pass are yet to be settled. But it is our intention that modelling will be undertaken by ABARES. That will be used to understand any local impacts. As you know, the government also proposes that, where there are impacts on local communities, there will be resources made available to those communities to assist them should voluntary water buybacks take place as part of water recovery.
