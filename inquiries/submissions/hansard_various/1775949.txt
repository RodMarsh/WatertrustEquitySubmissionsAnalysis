                      ( South Australia — Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate ) ( 12:00 ):  I know the government has had the proposal for quite some time, so I'm wondering: would the idea of a water-sharing covenant as a mechanism qualify under existing legislation as a held environmental water asset, and, therefore, would it—should it be accepted—count towards SDL? Do the parameters that you talk about enable that?
