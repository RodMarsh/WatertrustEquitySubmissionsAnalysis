                      ( Queensland ) ( 10:54 ):  Minister, I listened to your answers to Senator Pauline Hanson's questions earlier. Minister, following on from your response to Senator Hanson early today regarding consent from basin states, has the council of water ministers approved the amendments to the Water Act contained in this legislationâ€”yes or no?
