                      ( Victoria ) ( 19:08 ):  I'd be keen to hear from the minister at a later date what some of those commercial arrangements might be. You just talked about water that was committed to the Commonwealth before that, so were they leasebacks that you were talking about, as in leasing water back to the entitlement holder, not leasing to the Commonwealth? Could you just clarify that for me please.
