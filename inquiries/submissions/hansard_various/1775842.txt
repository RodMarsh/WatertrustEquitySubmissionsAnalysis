                      ( Victoria — Leader of the Nationals in the Senate ) ( 10:26 ):  What I'm hearing, Minister, is that this government is asking the parliament to sign off on a backflipped Murray-Darling Basin Plan which seeks to go into the market, remove the caps on buybacks and take the 450 gigalitres that was never supposed to be recovered unless there was already an understanding of the social and economic impacts. You're doing away with those protections for these rural communities—that's what I understand—because the analysis isn't happening until later. We're being asked to effectively sign a blank cheque and in blind faith accept that the Albanese government will understand the impacts and will do the maths on the impacts, but it won't stop you from taking the water from these communities.
