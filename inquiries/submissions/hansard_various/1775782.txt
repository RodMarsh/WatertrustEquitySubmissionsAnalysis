                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:11 ):  Thanks for your patience while I checked, Chair and Senator Davey. These are reasonably technical questions, and I wanted to make sure that I had the correct advice to provide to you. 
                 
                 
                   I'm advised that the water-sharing plans follow an accounting methodology that was based in New South Wales legislation. You may know from our discussions that I was, in fact, once involved in the processes that sought to establish the first of those water-sharing plans. The water resource plans are a requirement of Commonwealth legislation. They have their own distinct characteristics that are required to be accredited as water resource plans, and they are a precondition for accreditation under the plan. For that reason it was necessary for New South Wales to take the steps to establish water resource plans in addition to the water-sharing plans that were already in place.
