                      ( New South Wales —Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 09:18 ):  Just on the public tracking, because it's relevant, there is already, and has been ever since 2012, online tables published by both the MDBA and the department in all its guises as to water recovery—what the targets were, what the shared recovery targets were and what water recovery has been.
