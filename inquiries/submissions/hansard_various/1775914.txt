                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 11:27 ):  My advice is that the department has commenced engagement with basin states on draft design principles for the proposed Sustainable Communities Program. Peak stakeholders, including First Nations, CMAs, irrigators, environmental stakeholders and local councils are also being engaged on the principles that would underpin the Sustainable Communities Community Adjustment Assistance Program. Our expectation is that, should the legislation pass, that would commence next year. The quantum and delivery mechanism for this program would be finalised following passage of the bill.
