                      ( Australian Capital Territory ) ( 10:39 ):  Minister, one of the things that was raised with me by all stakeholders was the concern about water quality. There was recognition that quantity is important but quality wasn't being focused on. I'm interested in what the government's plans are when it comes to water quality. Things like carp were raised with me constantly, along with other invasive fish species and riverbank erosion when the rivers are running full. What will be done for water quality across the basin?
