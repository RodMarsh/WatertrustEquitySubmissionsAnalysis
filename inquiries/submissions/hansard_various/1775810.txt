                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:40 ):  I don't know if I can add to the answer. Of course the Commonwealth is able to legislate in the matters that are in our powers, and we bring legislation before you very confident that we have the power to legislate in the way we propose. We are also in regular discussions with basin states, and the minister has reached an agreement about the approach with the Commonwealth, the New South Wales government, South Australia, Queensland and the ACT governments. That provides a range of additional supports for those governments to work on full implementation of the plan, and we were pleased to be able to work with them on this.
