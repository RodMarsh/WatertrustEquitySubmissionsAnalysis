                      ( New South Wales — Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 11:00 ):  I've already answered this question a number of times. This legislation is consistent with the agreement that we have reached with South Australia, New South Wales, the ACT government and Victoria—Queensland, not Victoria; my apologies. So, for clarity: South Australia, New South Wales, the ACT and Queensland.
