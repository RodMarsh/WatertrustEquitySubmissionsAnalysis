                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 11:25 ):  Thanks, Senator Ruston. I addressed this earlier, in response to questions from Senator McKenzie. The particular configuration of tools and their application in different locations is yet to be finalised. However, ABARES modelling is being conducted which will inform the final design of any water recovery program, and that modelling is not yet completed.
