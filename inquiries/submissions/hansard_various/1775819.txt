                      ( Queensland â€” Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation ) ( 09:39 ):  You are not answering my question. My understanding is that there has to be an agreement between the states to do with the Basin Plan and the Commonwealth for anything to be put up. Was there a total agreement right across the board on your bill with regards to this legislation before you put it up in the chamber? Is there a total on agreement on the full proposal in your legislation by the states?
