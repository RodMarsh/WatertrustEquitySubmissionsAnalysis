                      ( Queensland â€” Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation ) ( 10:01 ):  Minister, what are you putting in place to rein in the states from actually allocating these licences? If you feel that there is more water needed for the environment, why are you allowing them to hand out more licences to these people?
