                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 10:25 ):  I'm indicating to you, Senator McKenzie, that the government's implementation arrangements following passage of this legislation are yet to be finalised. But, yes, we have asked ABARES to do this work because, of course, the government will seek to understand the economic impacts of any specific implementation arrangements.
