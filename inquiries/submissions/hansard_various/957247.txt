                    ( Tasmania â€” Assistant Minister for Forestry and Fisheries and Assistant Minister for Regional Tourism ) ( 16:30 ):  I seek leave to make a short statement on the motion. 
               
               
                 
                   The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:   Leave is granted for one minute. 
               
               
                 
                   
                     Senator DUNIAM: 
                     The Morrison-McCormack government is committed to the Basin Plan. The Basin Plan implementation is a shared responsibility between basin governments. On 4 September this year, Minister Pitt announced the $270 million Murray-Darling Communities Investment Package, which brings basin communities back to the heart of the Basin Plan. We've considered the reports and listened to communities. We're moving towards off-farm efficiencies and have ruled out any further buybacks. We're delivering outcomes for regional basin communities and the environment. Stunts like this one from Labor do nothing to deliver for communities or for the environment.
