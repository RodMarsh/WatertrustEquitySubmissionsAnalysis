                      ( New South Wales â€”Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 12:08 ):  I'm still interested in the whole leasing arrangements. Can you explain the amendments before us for changes to the definition of 'held environmental water'? Where they include the terminology 'or the part of the right' or 'part of such a right', what does that mean? If that is not a lease, what does it mean to acquire part of a right?
