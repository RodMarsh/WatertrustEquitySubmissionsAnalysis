                    ( South Australia ) ( 16:33 ):  I seek leave to make a short statement. 
               
               
                 
                   The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:   Leave is granted for one minute. 
               
               
                 
                   
                     Senator PATRICK: 
                     I won't be supporting this amendment from Senator McKenzie. The plan involves a number of stakeholders—including the environment, pastoralists, irrigators, tourism operators and recreational users—and it has been laid out and agreed amongst all of the states. When it gets tough for the irrigators, they quickly say: 'Let's change the plan. Let's not deliver the plan. Let's do something different.' It's quite disingenuous, and it's quite disrespectful to the fact that the plan has been agreed by all and involves compromise by all. Irrigators need to understand the importance of the plan and stick with it. 
               
               
                 
                   The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:   The question is that the amendment moved by Senator McKenzie be agreed to. 
               
               
                 Question negatived. 
               
               
                 
                   The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:   The question is that general business notice of motion No. 917, standing in the name of Senator Farrell and others, be agreed to. 
               
               
                 Question agreed to.
