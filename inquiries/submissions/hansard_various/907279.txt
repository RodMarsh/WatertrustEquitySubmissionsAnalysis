                    ( Queensland ) ( 16:29 ):  I seek leave to make a short statement. 
               
               
                 
                   The PRESIDENT:   Leave is granted for one minute. 
               
               
                 
                   
                     Senator CHISHOLM: 
                     Labor sought to amend this motion and make it clear that we want climate change to be a critical component of the review of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Unfortunately, this wasn't possible in the time allowed. 
               
               
                 Labor would like to put on the record that the plan, and how water is managed in the basin, takes into account climate variability. Water is allocated to any user based on availability. In a wet year, when the dams and rivers have more water in them, more water will be available for use. In a dry year, the opposite happens: allocations are reduced. The way the plan has been established aims to specifically address climate change through 10-yearly reviews. The reviews are required; they aren't optional. This means that climate change and changes in patterns can be considered. 
               
               
                 
                   The PRESIDENT:   The question is that motion No. 1320 be agreed to.
