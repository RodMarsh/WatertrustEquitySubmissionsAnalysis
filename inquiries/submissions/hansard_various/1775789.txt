                      ( New South Wales â€”Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 09:10 ):  On this same theme, currently the New South Wales water-sharing plans apply in the same way as the water resource plans. Why haven't these assessments been done just utilising the water-sharing plans? Is there a reason why it hasn't been done to date by using the existing state regulations that are in place?
