                      ( South Australia ) ( 11:29 ):  by leaveâ€”I move: 
                 
                 
                   Paragraph (b), omit "prior to the commencement of government business", substitute "at the conclusion of question time". 
                 
                 
                   This would require the minister to appear before the chamber at the conclusion of question time, as opposed to the beginning of the day.
