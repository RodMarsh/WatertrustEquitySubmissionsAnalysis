                      ( New South Wales — Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:41 ):  We will continue to work very closely with all basin states on implementation of the plan. Incidentally—you didn't ask about this—we also intend to work closely with communities in the basin about implementation of the Basin Plan. This legislation seeks to give the Commonwealth government and all of the basin states more time to work through this. The plan was not on track when we came to government. We received advice that it was not on track and that, under current policy settings, it could not be implemented. It's for that reason we are bringing legislation to the chamber and it is also for that reason we continue to talk to our state and territory colleagues.
