                      ( South Australia â€” Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate ) ( 12:04 ):  On notice could you provide this chamber as soon as possible with your evaluation of whether the concept of the Water Futures Efficiency Program is something that would fit within the legislation, subject obviously to its passage? I want to ask a quick question that's not exactly in relation to this. How much water is yet to be recovered to meet the full planned target?
