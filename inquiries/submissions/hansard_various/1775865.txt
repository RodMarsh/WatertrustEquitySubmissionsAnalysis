                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 10:55 ):  Senator Roberts, I think the best answer I can provide is that it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth government to formulate legislation and bring it in to the parliament. But, of course, we have been working with the basin states since we came to government to understand how together we could establish arrangements that would see the Basin Plan implemented. This legislation is part of that approach, and the approach that we are enabling through the legislation has been canvassed, and I've indicated to you that an agreement about that approach has been reached with South Australia, New South Wales, the ACT and Queensland.
