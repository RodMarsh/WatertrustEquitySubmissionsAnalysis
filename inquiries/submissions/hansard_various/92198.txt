â€”As I indicated, a certain plan is being provided to the states and, hopefully, being released this week. I will refer to that in the summing-up. To a large extent, it will depend on the response of the states. Like you, Senator Siewert, we would like to see this go forward as quickly as possible, but, at the end of the day, there is the requirement of cooperation.
