                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 11:04 ):  The legislation before us enables voluntary water purchase. Voluntary water purchase can be undertaken, in the context of the market, from willing sellers. It's possible for any actor to enter the water market and make a purchase if there is a willing seller.
