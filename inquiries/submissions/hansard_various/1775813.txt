                      ( Queensland â€” Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation ) ( 09:41 ):  In light of the fact there have been numerous amendments put to this bill which will impact on communities across all the states involved in the Basin Plan, what is your proposal now, if these amendments get up, to have a consultation process with the states that they will agree with these amendments as well?
