                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:32 ):  I totally reject that characterisation. I've explained to you the very sensible reasons why it is that the government has indicated this aspect of the budget is not for publication. It is to avoid distorting the water market and also to ensure that we obtain best value for the taxpayer.
