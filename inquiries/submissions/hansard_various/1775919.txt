                      ( New South Wales — Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 11:48 ):  I wonder if it would help if I read section 108 of the existing act, because it makes it reasonably clear what is possible. That section defines 'Commonwealth environmental water holdings' and it sets out that these are: 
                 
                 
                   … the rights that the Commonwealth holds that are water access rights, water delivery rights, irrigation rights or other similar rights relating to water; and 
                 
                 
                   … the interests in, or in relation to, such rights. 
                 
                 
                   And then subsection (2) goes on to say that, without limiting the above, Commonwealth environmental water holdings include rights of a kind referred to in that first paragraph 'that the Commonwealth holds on trust or holds as a lessee'. So, notwithstanding anything that happens in the chamber today, the Commonwealth can already hold water, as part of Commonwealth environmental water holdings, as a lessee. I'm also advised that, under limited circumstances, it's possible for the Commonwealth to lease water back to a productive user, but the circumstances are quite limited and they are time limited.
