                    ( Queensland â€” Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister ) ( 15:57 ):  I seek leave to make a short statement.  
               
               
                 
                   The PRESIDENT:   Leave is granted for one minute.  
               
               
                 
                   
                     Senator McGRATH: 
                     The government is firmly committed to delivering the Murray-Darling Basin Plan on time and in full. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister swiftly initiated a basin-wide review of state based compliance and enforcement in response to various media reports. The Prime Minister announced the outcomes of the review on 25 November and committed to implementing its recommendations and working with basin jurisdictions to strengthen compliance. The allocation of ministerial portfolios and administrative arrangements is a matter for the Prime Minister and not for direction by the Senate.
