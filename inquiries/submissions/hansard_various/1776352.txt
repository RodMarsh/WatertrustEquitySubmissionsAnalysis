                      ( Victoria ) ( 19:03 ):  I've got a couple of quick questions for the minister. Minister, you'll be aware that in the bill there is now the provision for water to be leased to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. Can you talk the Senate through some of the details of what that leasing will look like?
