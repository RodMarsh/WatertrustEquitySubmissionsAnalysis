                      ( New England ) ( 13:22 ):  There's something I feel incredibly passionate about: the economic viability of the regional towns that have sustained me through my life, whether that was Moree, where I lived, St George, Dirranbandi or even where I am at the moment. I grew up in Danglemah. It's in the Murray-Darling Basin. There are other towns such as Deniliquin, Griffith, Shepparton and Mildura—in the electorate of Mallee, that of the good member beside me. We can divide this speech and the speeches we hear today up between those who live and rely on the Murray-Darling Basin and those who live outside it and are commentators on it. It is amazing how quickly, back in 2013, whilst in the parliament, the people of the ACT managed to take Cotter Dam from 3.9 gigalitres to 78,000 megalitres—without a blink. The issue is, if you're taking water out for Canberra, that's A-OK, but, if you're taking water out for somewhere else, that's not. The previous speaker stated that we have to do this or we will permanently be in drought. I can tell the good member that, if we take this water out, some towns will be permanently in drought. In fact, they'll have no reason to exist. Sine qua non is the Latin for it—without this, nothing. One of the reasons I'm passionately attached to this is that I negotiated the initial deal with then minister Burke, the member for Watson. For the history of this— 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Dr Leigh: 
                       A moment ago we heard you didn't support it 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr JOYCE: 
                       You should listen. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Dr Leigh: 
                       I'm trying to keep up here. Did you support it or not? 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       The DEPUTY SPEAKER  
                     
                     ( 
                     Mr Georganas 
                     ):   Order! Direct your comments through the chair. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr JOYCE: 
                       I absolutely did, and do you want to know why? I'll take the interjection. Do you want to know why I supported it? At that point in time, the Greens were going to run off with 6,000-plus gigalitres, completing decimating the Murray-Darling Basin. And the good and learned member for Watson, the then water minister, Mr Anthony Burke, said that what we could do was to go to 2,750. That's where we landed. That 450 was there, but it had an economic and social detriment clause. I believe that, in a way, that's better than neutrality, because that way you can say: 'I win here, I lose there; therefore, it's neutral.' No. 'Social and economic detriment'—any detriment, and you could not go forward. That was the position of the Australia Labor Party under Minister Burke. 
                 
                 
                   Now we have the member for Sydney with a completely alternative policy. This is substantially and diametrically different. So to which person do we owe gratitude for their wisdom? Does wisdom reside with the member for Watson, or does wisdom reside with the member for Sydney? 
                 
                 
                   I'll tell you what, this time—and I don't like to involve myself in Labor politics, but I'm going with the member for Watson. I'm going with your Leader of the House. I say to the member opposite who interjected: 'your Leader of the House'—I back him in. But you guys don't. You people don't. You've given up on it. So I back Minister Burke. They don't. They've given up on their own minister. Where does the wisdom reside—with which minister? 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Dr Leigh interjecting — 
                   
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr JOYCE: 
                       I take the interjection. Which minister do you believe is wiser, the member for Watson or the member for Sydney? Which one? You're confounding yourself. You always do. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       The DEPUTY SPEAKER  
                     
                     ( 
                     Mr Georganas 
                     ):   Order! All remarks will be made through the chair. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr JOYCE: 
                       What we have to understand is this. If we take this out, what is the future for Dirranbandi? What is the future for Mildura? What is the future for Shepparton? What are you putting on the table to give these people? What—a painted roundabout? A new park? What are you actually going to do for the people that you are going to send backwards? I can assure you: there will be farmers who'll take your money and go to reside on the Gold Coast; they'll be gone. But what will you do for the hairdresser? What will you do for the tyre business? What will you do for the schools when the children come out? It will put the schools at risk. What will you do for the hospital when there are not enough patients, so the doctor goes and the hospital is taken down? Do you realise, whilst you are talking about bringing equality to people in remote and regional areas, counterfactually and counterintuitively, you are putting forward a policy to make them poorer. 
                 
                 
                   One of the greatest advantages in where I used to live, in St George, for quite a while, while I built up an accountancy practice from a zero start, and then ended up with about 600 clients, was: a lot of my clients were Indigenous. Do you know what they had? Businesses. It's a great way to get ahead, small business: hotels; cotton chipping operations; farm machinery contractors. These people actually got ahead. And they got ahead on the basis of access to water. But what you're doing is saying: 'No, we'd prefer you go backwards. We're going to send you people backwards.' I know the member for Parkes has got some serious Indigenous businesses in the city of Dubbo—yet another one from an agricultural precinct, and the agricultural precinct of places such as Warren relies on irrigation. So you're taking all these people backwards. And you're doing it on a theme. The theme is: to garner an environmental vote in sections of urban Australia, you're willing to send regional Australia under a bus. 
                 
                 
                   I go back to the member for Watson. He was actually diligent enough to go out and do the research and understand this issue. As hard as it was, I believed at the time it was best to land a deal so we could remove the uncertainty that has surrounded this issue, so people could get on with their lives and accept the pain that was coming their way. And there was pain. There was massive pain from doing this. 
                 
                 
                   But the 450, as stated by the Australian Labor Party, was premised on a socioeconomic detriment test. Now, that is a premise of what you are now removing. So I can only say: you care nothing about socioeconomic detriment in regional areas, because your own actions are deriding that principle. 
                 
                 
                   Obviously water is an issue of importance no matter where you go. By the way, 425 gigalitres is what's in Sydney Harbour. This is a massive amount of water—450 gigalitres—coming out. We don't know where it's coming from. If they have to pull it from Goondiwindi, it won't be 450; it will be 4,500-plus. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       The DEPUTY SPEAKER  
                     
                     ( 
                     Ms Claydon 
                     ):   The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. If the member's speech was interrupted, he will be granted leave to continue when the debate is resumed.
