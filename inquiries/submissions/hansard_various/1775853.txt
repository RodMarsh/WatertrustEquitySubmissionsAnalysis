                      ( Victoria — Leader of the Nationals in the Senate ) ( 10:41 ):  Minister, you made reference to the level of consultation that's being done. It has been put to me by the dairy industry in Victoria, in particular, that they've kept turning up to engagement opportunities but they're never heard because they're in the wrong part of the basin and they aren't members of the Greens political party. They live in the basin and they want to be part of the solution; and the best decisions can be made when you make use of the people who are closest to the situation. The level of frustration and fatigue in these communities is from being silenced and, shall we say, compliantly listened to but not actually heard; everything they've been saying is falling on deaf ears. What I have heard this morning is that those socioeconomic protections are being removed. But I'm able to assist the minister on that, thanks to an FOI document from the Victorian government—and I can't believe this hasn't been fed to the federal government—which says that milk production is likely to be 33 per cent lower than without the Basin Plan. That is a drop in milk production of a third as a result of the decisions we're making here. If the Victorian government has done the modelling on the economic impacts, why don't you know the answers to my very simple questions?
