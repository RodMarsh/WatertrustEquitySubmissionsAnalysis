—Briefly, the amendments are opposed. The cap—or, more formally, the long-term average sustainable diversion limit, as defined in the bill—already provides for a variable limit on water use between water years, and this can potentially be expressed as a share under clause 23(2)(c) where the Murray-Darling Basin Authority determines that this is appropriate. As a matter of practicality and enforcement, all shares must be converted to a quantity, as this is what is monitored.

 
 Question negatived.
