—I move Greens amendment (18) on sheet 5361:

 
 
 
 (18)  Clause 110, page 126 (line 1), before “using”, insert “acquiring, holding or”. 
 
 
 This amendment would alter clause 110, Application of state laws to the Commonwealth environmental water holder. Subclause (1) of that is: 
 
 
 (1)  
Any requirement of a law of a Basin State that prevents a person from:
 
 (a)  
using, on land that the person does not own, water available ...
 
 

 
 
 This amendment changes that to ‘acquiring, holding or using’ to ensure that it is spelt out that the clause applies to the acquiring or holding of water, that a person does not own the use of that water. It makes that clear so that the acquiring or holding of water does not escape the clause.
