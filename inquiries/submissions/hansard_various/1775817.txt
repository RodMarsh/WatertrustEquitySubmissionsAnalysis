                      ( Queensland â€” Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation ) ( 09:38 ):  My understanding, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is that anything to do with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan must be agreed to by the Commonwealth and the states. If that be the case, have they agreed to your legislation, which was originally drafted by your government, before coming to this chamber?
