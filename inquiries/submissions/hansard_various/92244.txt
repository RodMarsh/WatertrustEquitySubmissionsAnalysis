—I will push my luck, and I am watching the clock. I ask the minister to give a commitment that he will try to address this under the IGA so that there is actually a clear information-sharing process. That process fell down because there was not an information-sharing process until after the event. I would hope, given that you are now giving greater emphasis to, or are being consistent with, the Ramsar convention et cetera—which is good—that there are even more compelling reasons for you to be able to get that information-sharing process right.
