                      ( New South Wales â€”Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 19:28 ):  In your answer to Senator Van, you also mentioned the suite of options that will be available to the Commonwealth to recover the 450 gigalitres. In your list, which included on-farm, off-farm, unsolicited purchase and voluntary purchase, you also mentioned rule changes. Can you explain to me how rule changes can contribute towards the 450 target?
