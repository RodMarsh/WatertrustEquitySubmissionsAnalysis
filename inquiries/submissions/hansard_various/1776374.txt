                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 19:27 ):  Water can already be leased to the Commonwealth by irrigators, as an alternative to purchase, under the existing act. However, the changes that we propose in relation to the way that we are addressing the 450-gigalitre target in this bill mean that water could be leased to the Commonwealth for that purpose in addition to the purposes that are already described under the existing legislation. I'm looking at the officials to confirm that I have stated this correctly.
