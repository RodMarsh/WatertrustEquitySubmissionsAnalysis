                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 11:54 ):  I understand the question you're asking, Senator Davey. I will need to seek advice. It's very specific. Would you mind if I did so? 
                 
                 
                   Senator Davey, the advice I have is that it's really dependent on the specific circumstances; it's difficult to answer in the abstract. The criteria are as I described to you earlier. The minister needs to be satisfied that it meets the tests that I read out earlier. The description you provided of an events based lease may or may not meet that requirement, depending on its specific characteristics. More generally, commercial mechanisms are of interest to the government. We want all the tools on the table to be able to reach the targets. The government are committed to consulting with water users about what might be possible to give us the best possible chance of getting there.
