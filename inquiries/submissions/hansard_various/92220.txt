—I do not know where to start on that one. I will sidestep the MIS issue, because it would be fair to say that Senator Heffernan and I might have disagreeing views in relation to that. Coming back to the issue at hand, which is water, the water market will be guided by the ACCC. They will have input into what is occurring. In general terms, one would assume that the market would operate, but of course it does have the ACCC’s involvement as well.
