                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:15 ):  This amendment itself doesn't change the role of the inspector-general, but you're correct that the inspector-general has a series of powers that include monitoring, implementation and establishment of water resource plans, and the government has been careful to ensure that in the broad the inspector-general does have the powers and resources necessary to perform the role that's been established for that position.
