                    ( South Australia ) ( 15:59 ):  I seek leave to make a short statement.  
               
               
                 
                   The PRESIDENT:   Leave is granted for one minute.  
               
               
                 
                   
                     Senator HANSON-YOUNG: 
                     This motion clearly identifies that there is a conflict of interest between the minister holding responsibility for both the agriculture and the water portfolios. The minister, Barnaby Joyce, has already admitted that he has a conflict of interest because he said that his primary priority is looking after big irrigators, not the river and not the environment. It is a clear conflict of interest, and this Senate is voting today to get it fixed.
