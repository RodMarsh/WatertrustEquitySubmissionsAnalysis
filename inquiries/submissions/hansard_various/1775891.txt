                      ( Queensland ) ( 11:05 ):  That leads to another question. What budget provisions are there for buying back water? What price is the basis of that budget provision, if any? What is the range of prices that you're expecting and that you're willing to pay? What's the upper limit on prices offered? What's the total provision?
