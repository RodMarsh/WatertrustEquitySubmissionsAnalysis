                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 12:12 ):  It simply seeks to create the space for commercial arrangements. It doesn't seek to specify how that might be executed. As I've indicated previously, the government is open to working with productive users to look for commercial arrangements that could meet environmental objectives should they wish to propose them. This amendment simply seeks to create space for such an arrangement to be brought forward.
