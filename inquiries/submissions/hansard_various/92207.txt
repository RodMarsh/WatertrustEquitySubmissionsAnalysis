—I refer the honourable senator to section 21(1), which says:

 
 
 The basin plan must be prepared so as to provide for giving effect to relevant international agreements. 
 
 Going to the definition section on page 15, line 14, you will see that ‘relevant international agreement’ means the following, including the climate change convention. So I think on this we are in heated agreement, and it is already all in there.
