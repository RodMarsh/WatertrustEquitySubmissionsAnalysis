                      ( New South Wales â€”Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 09:04 ):  Thank you for that clarification. Is it correct that one-off adjustments will be either debit or credit, depending on when the formula is applied? So, if a water resource plan area or SDL resource area is found to be in credit through that one-off adjustment process, that credit will then apply; by the same token, if it is found to be in debit, the debit will apply, noting the reasonable excuse clause?
