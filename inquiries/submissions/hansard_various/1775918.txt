                      ( New South Wales â€”Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 11:53 ):  Also for clarity: with something like an event based leasing arrangement that was contingent on seasonal conditions and environmental requirements at a point in time, is it the case that it would not count towards water recovery targets, even though it has a significant environmental benefit, because it is event based and not long term? Is my understanding correct that any lease that can currently count towards water recovery targets needs to be a permanent lease arrangement, not an event based arrangement?
