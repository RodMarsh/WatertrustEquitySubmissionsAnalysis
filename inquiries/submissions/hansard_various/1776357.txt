                      ( Western Australia ) ( 19:10 ):  I have a question for the minister: the $40 million for the Aboriginal Water Entitlements Program was announced in 2018 but there have been significant delays in its delivery. Having listened to the frustration of First Nations groups in the basin, the Greens have secured an increase in funding to $100 million to reflect delays and the loss of value in this fund. Would the minister please explain what work is being undertaken to end delays to deliver this program for First Nations water entitlements, including discussion of options about governance models?
