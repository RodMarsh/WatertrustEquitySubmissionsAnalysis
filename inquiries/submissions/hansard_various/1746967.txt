                    ( Riverina ) ( 13:59 ):  It was called the 'restoring our rivers' bill, but what it will be is a 'destroying our river towns' bill. That's what passed the lower house earlier today, and it will have such an effect on those people who grow food and fibre for this country. I say: shame on all of you and, in particular, shame on the Greens. They always want to take our water.
