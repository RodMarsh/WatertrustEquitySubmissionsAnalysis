                      ( South Australia — Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate ) ( 12:01 ):  Minister, I acknowledge there would be no reason why you would. This proposal has been with the government for some time. It's considered by the communities that live along the river as an interesting proposal. I would be keen if you could take it on notice, or your officials could take it on notice, to understand whether this type of product would meet the requirements of being a held environmental water asset and, therefore, whether it would count towards the SDL. It would be very convenient to know because it's an interesting concept. The minister has said that all options are on the table. I'm not asking you to say this particular proposal has been approved. What I am seeking to understand is whether the concept of a water-sharing—I will call it a water-sharing covenant for the sake of a better description. Are they the kinds of projects that would fit within the scope of this legislation as possible assets or programs that could go towards the SDL?
