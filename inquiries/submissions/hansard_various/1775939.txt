                      ( South Australia â€” Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate ) ( 11:57 ):  Minister, I was wondering, in further reference to the discussion you were having with Senator Davey: have there been any guidelines, scope or parameters put around other options? I notice the minister mentioned land use and water buybacks, off farm and on farm, and that all options are on the table. What are the parameters of the options on the table?
