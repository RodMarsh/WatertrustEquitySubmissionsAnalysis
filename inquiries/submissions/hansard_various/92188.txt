—Greens amendments (5) and (12) are opposed. In relation to amendment (5), we say that the provisions of clause 21(1) already provide the appropriate reflection of these treaties, and it would be inappropriate for the basin plan to be required to implement the requirements of domestic instruments such as those made under the EPBC Act. The instruments made under the EPBC Act should be implemented under that act. We believe that that would be the most appropriate course of action. In relation to Greens amendment (12), the basin plan will provide for requirements that water resource plans must meet. As the basin plan must give effect to relevant international agreements, the requirements will need to reflect the obligations under those agreements.

 

 

 
 Senator Siewert 


—I apologise, Minister. Could you go back over the first bit about why we do not need this, because it is already happening?

 


 

 
 Senator ABETZ 


—Is that in relation to amendment (5) or (12)?

 


 

 
 Senator Siewert 


—Amendment (5).

 


 

 
 Senator ABETZ 


—The notes I have in front of me say that the provisions of clause 21(1) already provide the appropriate reflection of these treaties, and it would be inappropriate for the basin plan to be required to implement the requirements of domestic instruments such as those under the EPBC Act. The instruments made under the EPBC Act should be implemented under that particular act.
