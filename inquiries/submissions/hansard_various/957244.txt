                    ( Australian Capital Territory â€” Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate ) ( 16:30 ):  I seek leave to make a short statement on the amendment. 
               
               
                 
                   The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:   Leave is granted for one minute. 
               
               
                 
                   
                     Senator GALLAGHER: 
                     The opposition will be opposing Senator McKenzie's amendment. The amendment reflects the views of many in the Morrison-McCormack government and is a perfect demonstration of why the Morrison-McCormack government cannot be trusted to deliver the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.
