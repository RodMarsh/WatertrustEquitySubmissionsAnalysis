—If the world were perfect, I might agree with you; but the fact is the world is not perfect. The most recent example is that community organisations have documented evidence—photos, times et cetera—of water being siphoned off and stolen. That information has been provided to the authorities and no action has been taken. These particular organisations would welcome the opportunity to take action themselves if the relevant authorities were not prepared to do it. In the past that information has been provided to the authorities and no action has been taken. As I said, if it were a perfect world I might agree with you, but the world ain’t perfect.
