                      ( New South Wales — Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:08 ):  You are correct that this mechanism would be initiated at the point in time when a water resource plan is accredited. I'm advised that your broad characterisation that, once adjusted, it would then allow the standard protocols to apply is correct.
