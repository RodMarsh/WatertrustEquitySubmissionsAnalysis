â€”I will now go to a hypothetical case rather than that specific case, but I will use the nature of that case as an example. Going to a different scenario: if various plans agree that environmental flows are to be released into a Ramsar wetland, and that water is stolen and evidence of that is collected by the community, whom do they take it to? Do they take it to the state? Do they take it to the Commonwealth? Do they take it to both?
