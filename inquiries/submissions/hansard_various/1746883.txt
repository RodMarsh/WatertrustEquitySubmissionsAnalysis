                      ( Sydney — Minister for the Environment and Water ) ( 11:01 ):  I know exactly where the member for Indi is coming from. She's talked about relying on the science if we are purchasing water and being strategic in those purchases. Of course, the government will do that. But I believe the proposed amendment, as drafted, is unnecessary. 
                 
                 
                   What I really want to do is keep the Water for the Environment Special Account as flexible as possible. The Leader of the Nationals has spoken a number of times about water purchase. I've said in this place—and I've said it consistently, including just this morning to the National Farmers Federation—that it's not the first tool we reach for; it's not the only tool in the box. One of the reasons that we want to keep this flexibility in the Water for the Environment Special Account is so that, if we have other options, including on-farm water efficiency options, water purchase and also other infrastructure programs, rules changes and so on, we have that full suite of options available to us in meeting the objectives of the plan. Consequently, the government won't be supporting this amendment; it is unnecessary. As was set out in the agreement of 22 August 2023, we are proposing as a government that projects that are funded from the Water for the Environment Special Account be based on an overall assessment of value for money, informed by minimising socioeconomic impacts on communities. We will, of course, consider both environmental, utility and water market price, and consequently the government won't be supporting this amendment. 
                 
                 
                   Question negatived.
