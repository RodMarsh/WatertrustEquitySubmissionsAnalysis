                    ( Queensland ) ( 15:58 ):  I seek leave to make a short statement.  
               
               
                 
                   The PRESIDENT:   Leave is granted for one minute.  
               
               
                 
                   
                     Senator CHISHOLM: 
                     Barnaby Joyce and the Nationals are white-anting the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, and the Liberals are just sitting back and letting them do it. They continue to put Barnaby Joyce's career ahead of delivering the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full and on time. We've now seen a series of reviews and reports raise extremely serious concerns about compliance and enforcement, particularly in New South Wales: The Matthews report; the New South Wales Ombudsman's report; the  Murray-Darling Basin water compliance r eview ; and the Commonwealth Auditor-General's review of  New South Wales â€™ protection and use of environmental water in the Murray-Darling Basin.  We've also seen the previous head of New South Wales water, Gavin Hanlon, refer himself to ICAC. Barnaby Joyce and the Nationals can't be trusted with the water portfolio. Labor supports this motion.
