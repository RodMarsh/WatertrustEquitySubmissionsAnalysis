                      ( Goldstein ) ( 11:54 ):  I move amendment (2) as circulated in my name: 
                 
                 
                   (2) Schedule 1, item 1, page 4 (line 6), omit "2027", substitute "2026". 
                 
                 
                   As the minister mentioned previously, the legislation incorporates a number of reviews. Mine is simple. The existing legislation sets a review of the act for 2024. Because of the delays entrenched in this bill, the government is proposing that it be delayed until 2027. There is an argument, given what we've seen over the lifetime of the plan, that it should remain at 2024, particularly given the integrity issues within the system. As a compromise, I'm suggesting in this amendment that it be 2026, based on the advice of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists and others, a year before the latest commitments for this much-delayed plan are due to be met. Transparency and accountability are paramount to the success of this plan, from my point of view, and, of course, that was a key pillar on which I and other members of the crossbench were elected. 
                 
                 
                   Question negatived.
