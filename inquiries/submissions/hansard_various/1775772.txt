                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:13 ):  I will see if we have anything that I can provide in relation to that. I suspect the answer is, pending the accreditation of all water resource plans, that we'd be unlikely to speculate about their content. But if we do have any advice that I can provide I'll come back to you.
