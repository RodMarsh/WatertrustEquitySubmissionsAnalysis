                      ( Queensland â€” Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation ) ( 09:51 ):  All I said to you was that I requested to know who owns the water and the water licences. You've told me that you have carriage of this and you consult with the states. You have carriage of this bill. You are in control of this legislation. Why can't I find out on behalf of the Australian people who owns the water licences?
