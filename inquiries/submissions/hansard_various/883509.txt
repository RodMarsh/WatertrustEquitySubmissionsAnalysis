                      ( South Australia — Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate ) ( 13:47 ):  I seek to speak in respect of the Water Amendment Bill 2018. Labor support the Water Amendment Bill 2018 because we need to get the Murray-Darling Basin Plan back on track. 
                 
                 
                   The basin's sustainable health has always been a priority for Labor. In 1994, the Keating Labor government brokered the COAG agreement that established the framework for the Murray-Darling Basin reform that survives to this very day. In 2007 the Murray-Darling Basin Authority was established, and Senator Penny Wong, as water minister, started to acquire water for environmental use. In 2012 Tony Burke finally achieved what had escaped governments for 100 years, namely an agreement on a plan that prioritised the sustainable health of the entire Murray-Darling Basin system. 
                 
                 
                   The goal of the plan is to deliver a healthy river, and Labor still puts that outcome ahead of politics. We delivered a plan for the recovery of 2,750 gigalitres for the environment and an additional 450 gigalitres of water for the environment from on-farm infrastructure. The plan includes a mechanism to allow 450 gigalitres of water to be added as well as a reduction of up to 650 gigalitres, but only if the health of the environment isn't jeopardised. To test that requirement the plan includes environmental targets that need to be delivered. The 450 gigalitres came with a funding package of $1.77 billion that Labor delivered in 2012. That package is for on-farm water projects that provide the Commonwealth with water and money to remove constraints in the basin to allow the water to get to where it is required. Barnaby Joyce put the 450 gigalitres of water for the environment in doubt. The package of measures Labor recently agreed on with the government overcomes that problem by locking in that 450 gigalitres once again. So the Greens can grandstand, as they have continued to do for the whole period of the debate about the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, but the reality is that the agreement that has been reached is what will enable the plan to be implemented. And let's not forget that they voted with Bob Katter against the plan in 2012— 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT  
                     
                     ( 
                     Senator Bernardi 
                     ):   Senator Farrell, would you please refer to members of the other place by their appropriate titles. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Senator FARRELL: 
                       I'm not sure what else— 
                 
                 
                   
                     The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:   'Mr Joyce', 'Mr Katter'— 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Senator FARRELL: 
                       Oh, 'Mr'. 
                 
                 
                   
                     The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:   Thank you. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Senator FARRELL: 
                       Yes, Mr Bob Katter and Ms Hanson-Young voted against the plan in 2012— 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Senator Hanson-Young: 
                       Senator Hanson-Young. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Senator FARRELL: 
                       Senator Hanson-Young voted against the plan—that's the point I'm trying to make here—as did Mr Katter. They voted against the plan when they had the opportunity to support the plan. And, of course, if they had their way— 
                 
                 
                   
                     Senator Hanson-Young interjecting — 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Senator FARRELL: 
                       Senator, I know you're up for re-election and you're trying to make an issue— 
                 
                 
                   
                     The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:   Please address your comments through the chair, Senator Farrell. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Senator FARRELL: 
                       Well, through you, because I'm sure— 
                 
                 
                   
                     The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:   And I'd remind Senator Hanson-Young that interjecting is disorderly. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Senator FARRELL: 
                       I'm sure, Acting Deputy President Bernardi, that you know that the only reason Senator Hanson-Young is taking this stand is not to benefit the Murray-Darling, not to benefit irrigators in South Australia and not to benefit the people of South Australia but simply to grandstand, firstly in the lead-up— 
                 
                 
                   
                     Senator Ketter interjecting — 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Senator FARRELL: 
                       Yes, that's right, Senator Ketter—not Katter, but Senator Ketter! She's grandstanding in the lead-up to her preselection. I know that she's beaten Mr Simms; I predicted that, as you might recall, on the night of the state election. She's managed to get the No. 1 spot and now she's grandstanding in the lead-up to the next federal election. But the reality— 
                 
                 
                   
                     Senator Hanson-Young interjecting — 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Senator FARRELL: 
                       Look, if you were trying to save the Coorong, Senator Hanson-Young, you'd be supporting the Labor Party's plan, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, and supporting what Labor has done to restore the health of the Murray-Darling Basin. And you shouldn't— 
                 
                 
                   
                     The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:   Order! Senator Farrell, I recognise that you're building up some momentum but I'd ask you to address your comments through the chair, and I would ask Senator Hanson-Young to cease interjecting. It is disorderly. 
                 
                 
                   
                     Senator Hanson-Young interjecting — 
                 
                 
                   
                     The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:   Order! 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Senator FARRELL: 
                       I'll finish on this point in respect of Senator Hanson-Young. She's seeking to use the Murray-Darling Basin for the benefit of her own re-election, not for the benefit of South Australian irrigators and not for the benefit of the community. She did that in 2012 and she's continuing to do it today. If they'd had their way then, we still might not have a plan at all. Not to agree to this bill today would further delay the implementation of the plan—and delay hurts the river. 
                 
                 
                   The agreement we've got includes the checks and balances needed to make sure that the plan gets back on track and that we're making progress towards a sustainable future for the health of the Murray-Darling Basin. The government has committed to the commencement of the recovery of the 450 gigalitres of environmental water through an expression of interest. Payment for the 605 gigalitres of supply projects is linked to the delivery of the 450 gigalitres of water for the environment. If the 450 gigalitres isn't being recovered, then funding for the 605 gigalitres won't be provided. The package is clear that the government will prioritise the removal of constraints, because there's no point in having water for the environment if we can't use it. It is also clear that the key to river health is the ability to move 80,000 megalitres per day across the South Australian border. 
                 
                 
                   There is also a provision to make sure that irrigators can't take environmental water. The  Four Corners  report revealed that some people were taking water, both legally and illegally, that was meant for the environment and diverting it instead to irrigation. That has to stop. Labor has ensured that the package agreed with the government includes, firstly, funding for more metering so we know what water is being used; secondly, no meter, no pump rules; thirdly, embargoes on environmental water; and, fourthly, daily extraction limits to protect environmental water. Labor will continue to work to make sure that all basin jurisdictions work together to deliver the plan for the sake of the future health of the river system and future generations of Australians.
