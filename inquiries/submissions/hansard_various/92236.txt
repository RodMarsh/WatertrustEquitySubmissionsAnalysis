—The minister will be aware that under the EPBC Act public standing provisions have been used on a number of occasions to enforce the legislation. The Greens have held the longstanding position that it is in the interests of the environment that the public have standing under various bits of legislation. We think it is particularly important for this piece of legislation in terms of enforcement. I take the minister to issues around a number of areas where environmental provisions are not being enforced. For example, water is being stolen, illegal bunds are being built and illegal drains are being dug et cetera. The Greens believe that the community having the ability to enforce legislation is a positive addition to such legislation and in fact holds government accountable. If the government is not prepared to act, this gives the community the capacity to act. There are instances in the Murray-Darling Basin where—and I have raised this issue in this place—water being provided for the environment is being stolen; it is not making it to the site that is supposed to be watered. That is just one example of why we think such public standing provisions are important. Again, that is a recommendation made by a number of organisations that made submissions to the inquiry, believing that this would strengthen this act. Again I ask the government: is giving the community the ability take these positions a positive in helping to empower communities and get positive environmental outcomes?
