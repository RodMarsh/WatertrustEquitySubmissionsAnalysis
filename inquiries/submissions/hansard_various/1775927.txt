                      ( South Australia â€” Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate ) ( 11:28 ):  I put to you, Minister, that having the experience of the last 12 years of the implementation of the plan, and the water that has been taken out of river communities in the process of getting to the targets we've already achieved, there has been very significant impact on river communities. This brings in a piece of legislation that the government has admitted is likely to cause negative impacts to river communities, and we then find that the government hasn't even bothered to quantify that impact, despite the fact that we have got a whole heap of information that would be very easily and readily accessible in terms of the impacts that occurred along our river communities so far. The government is seeking to ask this chamber to pass a bill knowing it has significant negative impacts, I would contest, on river communities. Is that what the government's asking? They're asking the senators in this chamber to, hand on heart, come in here and vote for a piece of legislation that we know will have negative impacts on the river communities, including the one that I live in?
