                      ( Queensland ) ( 11:01 ):  The Victorian water minister, on a question from a One Nation member of the Legislative Council in Victoria, Rikkie-Lee Tyrrell, advised that Victoria had not signed off on the changes. You note this in the bill's explanatory memorandum. On what basis did you not advise the Senate, in response to Senator Hanson's questions, that you did not have approval from Victoria? You have just admitted it now, but you didn't with Senator Hanson.
