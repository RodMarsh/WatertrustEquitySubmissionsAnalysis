                    ( South Australia ) ( 16:31 ):  I seek leave to make a short statement. 
               
               
                 
                   The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:   Leave is granted for one minute. 
               
               
                 
                   
                     Senator HANSON-YOUNG: 
                     I'd like to put on the record that the Greens will not be supporting Senator McKenzie's amendment to this motion. I point to paragraph (c) in particular, which talks about the problems, as the National Party describe them, with the 450 gigalitres. I want to make it very clear that any South Australian senator who votes for this will need to go back to Adelaide and explain why they've just sold out our state. Whether it's Senator Birmingham, Senator Fawcett or any other Liberal coalition member who votes for thisâ€”prepare to see the wrath of the South Australians when you've sold us down the river.
