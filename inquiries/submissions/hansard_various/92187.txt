â€”The amendment is opposed. Clause 20 already provides for basin-wide environmental objectives for water dependent ecosystems to be set. Further to that, clauses 28(2) and 28(3) provide for the specification of targets to be set as part of the environmental watering plan, including flow targets. Setting targets of this nature should be on the basis of best available science and that is precisely what the independent expert Murray-Darling Basin Authority will be charged with doing, on the basis of the merits of the case for the use of the water available.

 
 Question negatived.
