                      ( New South Wales â€”Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 11:47 ):  In relation to leasing, as to water entitlement owners, is it a one-way lease arrangement? Is it only that the Commonwealth must own the water and can lease it back, or can a water entitlement holder retain the ownership of the licence and enter into a leasing agreement to lease that water to the Commonwealth?
