                      ( Western Australia ) ( 19:12 ):  Minister, just in discussions on some of the options around the governance model, can you confirm that there's the opportunity for an independent trust to be established for this $100 million? Could this money in fact be held by that independent trust versus the department, to ensure that self-determination is being exercised by First Nations people in the basin?
