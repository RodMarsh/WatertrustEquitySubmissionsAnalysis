                    ( South Australia ) ( 12:43 ):  I seek leave to make a short statement. 
               
               
                 
                   The PRESIDENT:   Leave is granted for one minute. 
               
               
                 
                   
                     Senator PATRICK: 
                     Centre Alliance does support the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, but we firmly believe that amendments are required to it—changes to deal with things like overextraction and mismanagement. In fact, that's one of the reasons why we have a select committee looking at how the Murray-Darling Basin is managed. We have a situation where, over the last two years, the New South Wales government have threatened to pull out of the plan six times. They need to stop behaving like a petulant child and get on board with the plan, working with all of the states to come up with a sensible plan. It does require amendment, but it does not require what has been suggested by the New South Wales government. 
               
               
                 
                   The PRESIDENT:   The question is that the motion moved by Senator Hanson-Young be agreed to. 
               
               
                 
                   
                   A division having been called and the bells being rung— 
                 
               
               
                 
                   The PRESIDENT:   I've had a request for a four-minute bell from the whips.
