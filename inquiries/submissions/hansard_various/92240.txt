â€”As I understand it, the stealing of water would be the crime of stealing under the various criminal jurisdictions of the various states, so that would remain in place. In the event that there was no satisfaction in relation to that aspect, I understand that if the same information were to be provided to the authority they could launch a prosecution. In fact, there would be two potential avenues to pursue a prosecution in the event of water stealing if this legislation gets through.
