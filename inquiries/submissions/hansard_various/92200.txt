—On the right-hand side of page 40 of the bill at section 2, item 3, ‘specific requirements’ are listed. On the other side of the page it states:

 
 
 An identification of the risks to the condition, or continued availability, of the Basin water resources. 
 
 That matter is to be included in the plan. If you go down to ‘(b) the effects of climate change’, you will see that it is specifically addressed.
