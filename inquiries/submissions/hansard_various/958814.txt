                    ( New South Wales ) ( 19:15 ):  I, and also on behalf of Senators Wong, Farrell, McAllister, Gallacher and Marielle Smith, move: 
               
               
                 That the Senate— 
               
               
                 (a) notes that: 
               
               
                    (i) on 7 December 2020 Senator McKenzie called on the Senate to note that 'delivering the Murray-Darling Basin Plan would threaten the productivity and resilience of industries', and 
               
               
                    (ii) on 23 October 2020, Senator Birmingham told the estimates session on cross portfolio Murray-Darling Basin Plan matters that 'Our government is doing everything it can to meet the legal obligations and expectations of the Water Act…'; 
               
               
                 (b) also notes that: 
               
               
                    (i) on 7 December 2020 Senator McKenzie also called on the Senate to acknowledge that 'the 450 gigalitres of 'up water' will result in significant socio-economic damage', and 
               
               
                    (ii) on 23 October 2020, Senator Birmingham said in relation to the 450 gigalitres that 'It is important for river health' and '…we will do everything we can to try to achieve those outcomes'; 
               
               
                 (c) further notes that the government's announced policies are not sufficient to guarantee delivery of the 450 gigalitres or the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full; and  
               
               
                 (d) calls on all coalition partners of the Government to guarantee that they are committed to delivering the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full.
