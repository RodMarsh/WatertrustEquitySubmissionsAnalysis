                      ( New South Wales — Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 19:11 ):  Thank you for the question, Senator Cox. I can confirm—and I did earlier in the chamber—that the government intends to increase the allocation available for the Aboriginal Water Entitlements Program. The funding originally provided, in 2018, was $40 million, under the former coalition government. Quite incredibly, no meaningful steps were taken to implement its arrangements. Since coming to government, the minister has prioritised the implementation of the Aboriginal Water Entitlements Program. Consultation has occurred with basin First Nations peoples and arrangements for an interim governance structure to manage the water is being designed. 
                 
                 
                   Delayed investment of the $40 million available through the program has prevented basin first peoples from receiving tangible benefits in the five years since the program was announced. That has meant a reduction, practically, in the value of the $40 million due to inflation and the rise in the cost of water in that time. On that basis, the government and the minister have committed to raising the funding from $40 million to $100 million. This funding will be used exclusively to purchase water entitlements. The government also commits to providing funds to cover transaction costs associated with the purchase and holding of water entitlements.
