                      ( New South Wales â€”Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 11:46 ):  That just creates more questions for me. Thank you for 'clarifying'! In relation to leasing, if the government enters into a leasing arrangement, will that be able to contribute to the 450-gigalitre water recovery target?
