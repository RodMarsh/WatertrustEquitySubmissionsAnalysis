                      ( New South Wales â€”Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 09:12 ):  Is there an expectation that there will be big differences, and therefore a big adjustment, from the current estimates? There have been estimates underway as to what the take has been in regard to these areas with no water resource plans. Does the government expect that applying this methodology will lead to big adjustments or big differences in those estimates?
