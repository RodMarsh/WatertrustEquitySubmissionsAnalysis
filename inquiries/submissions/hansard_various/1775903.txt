                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 11:20 ):  Thanks, Senator Ruston. I'm not sure that your question reflects the actual bill before us. There is no change to the socioeconomic test. However, there are new provisions for water recovery to which the test does not apply.
