                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:43 ):  I don't think the government would consider that we have a binary choice between these two things. A sustainable healthy basin is essential for the productivity of the farm sector and for food and fibre production in Australia. The origin of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was actually to address the challenges that were being produced for basin communities as a consequence of poor management over the basin over many decades. That was the origin of the decision that was taken to establish the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The millennium drought really laid it bare. It became clear there were some very significant problems. You'll recall that parts of the basin dried up. The mouth of the Murray closed. Water didn't flow out to the sea. The whole basin system felt this. It devastated communities and industry and the environment. These things are connected. Water supply to Adelaide was threatened. Water was severely restricted to almost 4,000 irrigators in South Australia; 33 wetlands didn't receive water, risking long-term damage to their ecosystems; and, as the Lower Lakes dried up, acidic soils were exposed and damaged the quality of the water that was left in the river. The Basin Plan was a response to this acute crisis in the system, which actually made it clear that our agricultural activities, our communities and our environment are all deeply linked within the basin itself.
