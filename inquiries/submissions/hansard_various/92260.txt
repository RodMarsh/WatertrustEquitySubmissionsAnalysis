—This batch of amendments is opposed. We say that the authority’s main role is the preparation and enforcement of the basin plan. Clause 20 of the legislation sets out the purpose of the plan, which is to provide for the integrated management of the basin water resources in a way that promotes the objects of the act. The government considers that this requirement gives the MDBA responsibility for meeting the objects of the act within the scope of its functions. The government notes that meeting some of the objects of the act are more a responsibility of the ACCC or the Bureau of Meteorology than a responsibility of the authority.

 
 In relation to amendment (23), we say that that matter is in fact covered by clause 172(1)(c). The addition of the words ‘long-term health of basin waterways’ is covered by the generality of the clause, which deals with the condition of the water dependent ecosystems. In relation to amendment (24), which seeks to add the words ‘with specific attention to river wetland and estuary health’, there is the potential to assert that that in fact constrains the clause and that emphasis would be given to these particular issues as opposed to the generality of basin water resources and ecosystems. We do not think that there is a need to stress some particular aspects over others. We believe that the totality of basin water resources and ecosystems should be considered.
