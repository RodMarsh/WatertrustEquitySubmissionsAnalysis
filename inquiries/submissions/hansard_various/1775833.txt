                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:55 ):  At different times, since the commencement of the Basin Plan, the Commonwealth government has recovered water for environmental purposes, and it is held by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and utilised for environmental purposes. These go well beyond keeping the mouth of the Murray open, an environmental objective you referenced in an earlier contribution. They are also utilised for watering wetlands, for ensuring the health of the rivers themselves and sometimes for topping up overland flooding events to ensure bird breeding events can be sustained or fish spawning activities can be catalysed. The Commonwealth has learnt quite a lot over the period of the operation of the plan about how to best use those water entitlements to produce environmental outcomes.
