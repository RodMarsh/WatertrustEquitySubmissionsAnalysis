                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 11:51 ):  The minister must be satisfied that the right, or the part of the right, decreases the amount of water taken for consumptive use relative to the benchmark conditions of development, increases the volume of the basin water resources that are available for environmental use and will contribute to enhancing environmental outcomes as set out in various sections of the act and the Basin Plan. There is an exception. Actually I don't think the exception is relevant to your question. Senator Davey, those are provisions in the bill that are before us, and they provide further guidance around the criteria that the minister would need to use to evaluate whether that right could be counted towards held environmental water.
