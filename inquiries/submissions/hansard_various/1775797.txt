                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:35 ):  Senator Davey, the targets that we are seeking to implement are the ones that have been agreed on a bipartisan basis since the plan was established. The decision to pursue water recovery to address overallocation in the basin and to provide for a healthy, working basin that could support communities, environment and economic activity is one that I thought was an agreed position across the chamber. This bill doesn't seek to change those targets. What it does do is offer opportunities for more time, more options, more money and more accountability. That is the overarching framework for this bill. It will deliver more water for the environment, more certainty for farmers and industries, more financial support for affected communities, more protection for native plants and animals, and more hope for Australia's most important river system. That's why the plan was put in place in the first instance. 
                 
                 
                   I have already indicated to the chamber that the final design of any water recovery options has not been completed. I've also indicated to you that of course the government undertakes the necessary analysis for any budget decisions that are taken in the context of the budget. Finally, I have indicated to you that the particular costs associated with water purchase are not for publication in the budget, for reasons to do with impacting on the market and ensuring that we obtain good value for taxpayers.
