                      ( Queensland â€” Leader of The Nationals in the Senate ) ( 19:01 ):  I seek leave to make a short statement. 
                 
                 
                   
                     The PRESIDENT:   Leave is granted for one minute. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Senator JOYCE: 
                       Isn't it the absolute height of hypocrisy: after the Greens sought to destroy the Murray-Darling Basin Plan with a disallowance motion, they then seek to destroy the vote with a guillotine. And it is a guillotine on their own motion. They are guillotining their own motion. It is the essence of why they cannot be responsible in any way, shape or form for the livelihoods of the people living in the basin. 
                 
                 
                   They are all theatre, they do not care, they are all about destruction and they are total and utter nihilists, whose only desire is for the theatrical and for a response to the theatrical. And the outcome of the theatrical is the destruction of the livelihoods of the people who live in the basin. It is a clear sign to all those who are listening to this debate that this is why you cannot trust them and this is why we had to do a deal with the Labor Party, because God help us if we ever had to deal with the Greens.
