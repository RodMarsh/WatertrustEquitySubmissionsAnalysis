                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:29 ):  I don't think I can add a great deal to my earlier answer, which is that updates will be provided as part of the budget, and, of course, any budget decision is subject to analysis. In the particular example you're referring to, we've indicated that we don't intend to make public the quantum of resource identified for buybacks for the reasons I explained earlier. I have also explained that the precise mix of levers and tools to meet the targets is yet to be finalised by government. This legislation simply seeks to unlock the capacity to utilise the widest possible range of tools to meet the targets that are in the plan.
