                      ( Queensland ) ( 10:58 ):  Thank you, Minister. I'd like to get more into the specifics of when, how and in what form. Can you please table the minutes of the most recent meeting of water ministers, where this bill would have been considered? I note those minutes have not yet been published on the council of water ministers' webpage, which is the normal procedure. Could you table them, please?
