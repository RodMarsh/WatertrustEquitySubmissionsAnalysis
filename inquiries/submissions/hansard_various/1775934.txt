                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 12:02 ):  Senator Ruston, I think you'll understand that I need to provide a fairly qualified answer: possibly. But, yes, the government's bill that we're debating today does contain provisions that introduce these principles for held environmental water that deliberately seek to broaden the ways that we could strike agreements with productive users about water use and that could count towards environmental targets. That is the thinking. I can't provide you an answer about whether the specific details contained in this particular proposal would meet those tests, but it is our intention to create space for conversations of that kind and then to have some clear and public criteria that could be used to evaluate whether these proposals would meet the requirements of the act.
