â€”Obviously it has an effect on the IGA. I will not go through all the arguments that we have been through, but obviously the Water Bill is absolutely dependent on an effective IGA. I put on record that a lot of the community organisations are extremely concerned that, because of the way the nature of the IGA is being negotiated, there is a lack of consultation through that process. A great deal of this bill is being delivered through the IGA and it is not subject to the consultation process, and we have some issues with some of the consultation that the bill was subject to.
