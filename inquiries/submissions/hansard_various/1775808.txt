                      ( New South Wales â€”Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 09:27 ):  I appreciate the budget processes. Industry groups, water brokers and other groups have tried to estimate how much this might cost the budget, and there are various figures. I think the NFF found it could be up to $5 billion just to purchase the extra 450 gigalitres. Argyle Capital Partners estimated the cost could be up to $10 billion. Other water brokers have looked at the whole shortfall and estimated it could be up to $20 billion. Has the government undertaken any economic work to actually estimate the cost of this water recovery, to facilitate the budget processes?
