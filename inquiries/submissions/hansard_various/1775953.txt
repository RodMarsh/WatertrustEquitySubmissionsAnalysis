                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 12:05 ):  I seem to remember having some very detailed exchanges with you about this exact same question across the estimates table when we were in different roles, Senator Ruston. I will seek advice and provide advice back to the chamber when I can. I feel certain that these numbers are available to us, but I do not have them at hand immediately.
