                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 19:15 ):  Senator Cox, thank you for your patience while I sought advice. I'm advised that discussions are taking place both at a national level and in the basin itself. I think the government recognises the importance of the input and the advice that we can receive from basin First Nations peoples, but there are discussions going on at both levels.
