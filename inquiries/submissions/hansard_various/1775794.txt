                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:16 ):  Senator Hanson-Young, you're right that you and I struggled under the previous government to extract adequate information about progress, particularly in relation to the 450 gigalitre target but also in relation to other aspects of the plan. The government is committed to providing regular updates on the department's website that will give the public an understanding of how we are going in making progress against the targets so that we have appropriate transparency around the recovery targets that we set.
