                      ( Queensland ) ( 11:00 ):  I note your words were that Minister Plibersek had briefed state ministers. That was in your earlier exchange with Senator Hanson. Briefing is not agreement. The communique from the council of water ministers would normally be proof of an agreement. This has not been issued. Can you please prove that the government has agreement between the basin states for the amendments to your bill?
