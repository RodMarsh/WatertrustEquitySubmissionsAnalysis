â€”I move:

 
 
 That this bill be now read a second time. 
 
 The  Water (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007  deals with the consequential matters in connection to the Water Bill, upon which I have just spoken. 
 This bill makes minor amendments to the Meteorology Act 1955, the National Water Commission Act 2004 and the Trade Practices Act 1974, which are required as a result of the measures contained in the Water Bill. 
 The amendments to the Meteorology Act 1955 will enable the Bureau of Meteorology to take on functions under the Water Bill, including to report on water use and availability and to forecast future water availability. 
 The amendment to the National Water Commission Act 2004 will enable the National Water Commission to carry out its auditing role established under the Water Bill. 
 The amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 are required to enable the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to use its general power of delegation in relation to its new functions under the Water Bill in the making and implementation of water charge and market rules in the Murray-Darling Basin, and to use its power to obtain information in section 155 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in relation to its new water functions. 
 Debate (on motion by  Mr Crean ) adjourned.
