                      ( New South Wales — Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 10:01 ):  I was speaking earlier, in response to a question from Senator Davey, about the water resource plans. These are the plans that need to exist in each of the catchments to show how much water is going to be made available for productive uses—that is, for licences. States do have a constraint, under the plan, on how much water they can license for take. 
                 
                 
                   There has also been an increasing focus in recent years on the role of the inspector-general and their capacity to enforce the extraction of water out of the systems of the Murray-Darling Basin. That's an important enforcement mechanism that sits on top of the policy mechanism that the water resource plans represent.
