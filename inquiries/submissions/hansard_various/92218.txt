—I was just being briefed in relation to aspects of the FMA Act, but I assume that the honourable senator is seeking information not about that but more about the science and things of that nature. I do have some information for her. The government believes the bill strikes the right balance between the independence of the authority and government accountability to the electorate. The minister’s capacity to give directions to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has been appropriately limited to reflect the independent and expert based nature of the authority, while ensuring that the democratically elected government has an appropriate role, if required, in important decisions such as those involving trade-offs between economic, environmental and social objectives. However, the minister cannot give directions on any matters of a scientific or factual nature. This means, for example, that the minister could not direct the authority to change its assessment of the water needs of particular ecosystems within the basin. However, the minister may direct the authority on priorities in circumstances where trade-offs need to be made. In all cases where the minister gives direction to the authority, which it is anticipated will be rare, the minister must table the reasons for such directions in parliament.

 
 In the case of directions relating to the basin plan, the minister must include reasons for not following the advice of the authority. I think the senator was also asking within what time frame that work had to be tabled. I am advised that that information would be tabled at the same time as the plan is tabled. The minister is also prevented from giving any directions to the authority in respect of any enforcement related action the authority decides to take. If there are any other matters in this bracket of amendments, I am happy to try to answer them.
