                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:37 ):  Senator Hanson, I apologise for the delay. I am seeking the information that you're looking for so I can give you accurate information about where we are up to in our discussions with states and territories. The Basin Plan is a shared responsibility across all of the basin states, and, of course, we are engaging with them regularly. I'm just looking for an update on where we are up to in our discussions.
