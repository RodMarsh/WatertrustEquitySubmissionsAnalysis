                      ( South Australia ) ( 09:13 ):  I'd like to ask the minister to confirm, in relation to this amendment, the role of the inspector-general in all of this to enforce compliance on extraction limits and water resources plans. This is a really important part of ensuring integrity and assuring the Australian community at large—in particular, the local communities in these basin regions—that there is a cop on the beat and that, when we put in place an inspector-general for water compliance, the inspector-general can actually do their job of ensuring water compliance.
