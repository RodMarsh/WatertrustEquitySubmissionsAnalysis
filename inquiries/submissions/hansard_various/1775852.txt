                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 10:43 ):  Senator McKenzie, about three times now I have stepped through the policy process the government is working through. I have indicated the advice that we will draw upon in finalising arrangements for water recovery, including any voluntary buybacks. I don't have anything to add to my previous answers.
