                      ( Riverina — Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance ) ( 17:38 ):  I am not sure about broken promises, but we just heard a broken record. The member for Wakefield is somebody from South Australia who is passionate—I will give him that—but he was talking about the overarching responsibility for water. It does not belong to the National Water Commission. It is the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. We heard the member for Makin earlier talking about meagre savings. That is precisely what is wrong with Labor. Labor cannot manage money. This is going to save $21 million. This is going to take $21 million off the bottom line. Those are not meagre savings; that is a substantial amount of money. That is what is wrong with Labor. If they do not think that $21 million is worth saving then there is something seriously wrong. 
                 
                 
                   We saw in the six years under Labor that Labor could not manage water. The National Water Commission is going to be wound up, consistent with the Commission of Audit recommendations and measures outlined in the 2014-15 budget. It is outlined in that budget. This bill abolishes the NWC by repealing the National Water Commission Act of 2004. It makes consequential amendments to the Water Act of 2007 to enable that to happen. It will transfer certain NWC functions to the Productivity Commission, where they should be, and it will provide transitional arrangements to facilitate the closure of the NWC. 
                 
                 
                   I do not often listen to the member for Wakefield and give him too much credibility, but someone I do give a lot of credibility to is Debbie Buller from my electorate. Debbie Buller and her husband, Stuart, own and lease 900 hectares of broadacre irrigation farm at Murrami. They grow rice, corn, wheat, oats, canola and barley. She is the president of an organisation founded in 2010 which I am also a founding member of, and that is the Murrumbidgee Valley Food and Fibre Association. She is also an executive member of the Ricegrowers' Association, NSW Farmers and the New South Wales Irrigators' Council. So when Debbie Buller sends me an email or says something on the phone, I listen. She talked to me this afternoon about increased bureaucracy. She is absolutely furiously in agreement with the coalition's bill that we are debating here now. We are about to hear from the parliamentary secretary, who will sum up on this bill, and then we will vote on it. 
                 
                 
                   When Debbie Buller recently wrote to me about increased bureaucracy she said: 'While there is some rationale behind claiming that some of the states had overallocated water, the Water Act 2007 and the subsequent Murray-Darling Basin Plan have not recognised the historical reasons for that overallocation and therefore not repaired the problem. They have instead exacerbated the problem.' She continued: 'Instead of simplifying and streamlining water regulation and management, this process has added at least four extra levels of independent bureaucracy.' She mentioned that CEWH, BOM, MDBA and the ACCC seem to be in a power struggle with the corresponding state entities. She listed the number of bureaucracies, state and federal, just in the southern connected system that are directly involved in informing water management operations, regulations and pricing. For the sake of the  Hansard , I am going to read them out. They are: the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Bureau of Meteorology, the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Primary Industries, the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal, Local Land Services, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, ministerial councils, the New South Wales Office of Water, the Office of Environment and Heritage, Snowy Hydro Ltd, the State Water Corporation, the Victorian government, the South Australian government, Coleambally Irrigation Ltd, Murrumbidgee Irrigation and Murray Irrigation Ltd. I am almost out of breath! That is how many organisations and layers and levels of bureaucracy that good farmers, such as Debbie and Stu Buller at Murrami, and the good people of the Murrumbidgee, Murray and Coleambally irrigation areas have to contend with. 
                 
                 
                   That is fine. But we are getting rid of the National Water Commission because we believe that the job can be done by other entities. We can lessen the bureaucracy. The Productivity Commission will be responsible for the triennial assessment of progress towards achieving NWI objectives as well as the biennial national water planning report card which is produced under the triennial assessment. 
                 
                 
                   
                     Mr Champion interjecting — 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr McCORMACK: 
                       You should listen, Member for Wakefield: you might learn something. Obviously in the 15 minutes of my life that you wasted talking about your ex-girlfriends, cars, submarines and all the rest of it— 
                 
                 
                   
                     Mr Perrett interjecting — 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr McCORMACK: 
                       At least the member for Braddon was talking about water, Member for Moreton. The Productivity Commission will also have responsibility for the independent audit of the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and associated water resource plans. The Department of the Environment will be responsible for assessing milestone payments to Murray-Darling Basin states against the performance milestones specified in the national partnership agreement on implementing MDB reform. The department will also provide advice on the status of the implementation of the National Water Initiative to the Clean Energy Regulator, as required under the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Rule regulations of 2011. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, ABARES, will take responsibility for monitoring water markets and producing an annual water markets report. The Bureau of Meteorology is working with state and territory governments and the water industry to continue the national performance reports for the urban water sector, which will provide a crucial annual snapshot of this section of the industry. The 2013-14 NPR was released on 7 May. Interestingly, just a week after that NPR was released, we heard from the Leader of the Opposition, who, in his budget in-reply speech, said: 
                 
                 
                   Confidence for new rail and roads and new ports and bridges, better social housing, smart energy grids, efficient irrigation projects and of course, the best digital infrastructure. 
                 
                 
                   So there we have the Leader of the Opposition talking about efficient irrigation projects. Labor members would not know an irrigation channel if they fell over one!  
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr Perrett: 
                       I worked on one. I was a cotton chipper for six years. My sister owned a cotton farm.  
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr McCORMACK: 
                      For six years we had a man-made drought. We had the Millennium Drought inflicted by mother nature on the irrigation communities of my area, the Riverina, and then for six years— 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr Perrett: 
                       Take that back! 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr McCORMACK: 
                       All right, I will take it back. There you go. He worked on an irrigation channel. Most of the members of the Labor Party would not know an irrigation channel if they fell over one.  
                 
                 
                   
                     Mr Perrett interjecting — 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr McCORMACK: 
                        I see the member for Moreton nodding, because he knows—present company excluded—that that is so true. Admittedly, Tony Burke came to Griffith, which is in my area, and bravely fronted the good folk there. Certainly, I gave him credit at those meetings, because it was important that we heard from him. He had a title as long as your arm—'population', 'sustainability', 'communities' and 'water'—but essentially water was in there. He was also a former minister for agriculture. At least he did go there. But the trouble with the minister was that he went, he listened but he did not act. We had a Murray-Darling Basin Plan which took so much water out of productive use in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, the MIA. It was just cruel to those farmers.  
                 
                 
                   I read now from a report from a very old book titled  Water into gold . I have to say that water is the most important thing that we will discuss in this House today. National security is obviously very crucial, too, but at this point in time water is one of the most crucial things that we will discuss in this House. The foreword to this book was written by Alex F Bell, CMG. He writes: 'The vision of Alfred Deakin that given water the most arid spaces could and would furnish produce the equal in quality of any grown throughout the world was realised by the courage of the Chaffeys and those who served under their banners and who, in the face of great handicaps, carried these river areas to a success, which has given prosperous cities and towns where 50 years ago a few sheep grazed on stations and regarded as dangerous country by the settlers who were opening up the pastoral districts of the Murray River area.' He could have easily included the Murrumbidgee area as well. That was out of the 1946 edition, the seventh edition, of this book. It is correct.  
                 
                 
                   What we saw when Labor was in power—and we talk of bureaucracy— 
                 
                 
                   
                     Mr Champion interjecting — 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr McCORMACK: 
                       I am not using these reports as a prop—was that Riverina farmers, the good farmers in the Murray and Coleambally areas and elsewhere in the Murray - Darling Basin area, including South Australia, were expected to go through these sorts of voluminous tomes, to analyse and read them, whilst they were getting on with the job—and they do a fine job, too—of growing the food and fibre to feed and clothe our nation.  
                 
                 
                   In the Riverina alone, the ABARES statistics for 2012-13—so that is a while ago and they have obviously increased in value since then—were that the gross value of agriculture production in New South Wales was $12.1 billion, of which 16 per cent came from the Riverina region. It is probably higher now. In 2012-13 wheat contributed $443 million to the value of agriculture production just in this region. Fruit and nuts, excluding grapes, accounted for 12 per cent—that is $231 million—with the major crops being oranges, $129 million; apples, $36 million; and cherries, $6 million. Canola accounted for 11 per cent at $227 million; rice seven per cent at $148 million; and vegetables six per cent at $127 million. The parliamentary secretary, Mr Baldwin, who is sitting beside me and who will in a moment sum up the bill, knows this well. He recently came to my electorate and visited Narrandera, Griffith, Coleambally and Whitton— 
                 
                 
                   
                     Mr Perrett interjecting — 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr McCORMACK: 
                       and Southern Cotton—and he saw for himself the great benefit that water gives to the Riverina region and the great benefits that the Riverina region gives by transforming that water into food and fibre to feed this nation and, indeed, many others. The parliamentary secretary saw it with his own eyes. He was impressed—as he should be. This legislation is very, very important. The cap on water buybacks of 1,500 gigalitres makes it doubly important that this legislation passes. The Abbott-Truss government is strongly committed to progressing water reform, and we will continue the principles of the National Water Initiative. The water sector has made great progress on water reform. The sort of reform that we want to see from this side of the House will make sure that we do not continue to buy water ad hoc out of those productive areas. What we are doing is we are capping the buyback, which is important, and we are capping— 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr Champion: 
                       You can only buy it from willing sellers, can't you. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr McCORMACK: 
                       But willing sellers, Member for Wakefield, were only willing sellers in many instances because their banks were forcing them to pay back the debt that they had, and there were many of them who were not willing sellers. They wanted to get on with the job of farming as their fathers had done, as their grandfathers had done, as their forebears had done when they first settled in the Griffith, Leeton and Narrandera areas back in the early 1900s. They were sent there by government to grow the food to feed this nation, and the government of their nation turned its back on them and implemented bad water policy, which we are now trying to fix.  
                 
                 
                   The key outcome sought from the legislation is the transfer of two statutory NWC functions to the Productivity Commission on an ongoing basis: the triennial assessments of progress by the National Water Initiative parties towards achieving the objectives and outcomes of the National Water Initiative and also the five-yearly audits of progress towards implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. That is what the National Water Commission was doing. It was not an overarching body, as the member for Wakefield made out in his contribution. It was implementing those five-yearly audits of progress towards the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. It was set up, as the member for Wakefield quite correctly pointed out, in 2004 by the former Howard government, but only for a period of eight years. Now we are 11 years on. The National Water Commission has done its job and it is time to say: 'Farewell and thanks.' With that, I will now sit and I will allow the Parliamentary Secretary to sum up this important piece of legislation.
