—If I understood your answer correctly just then, if the minister makes a direction that will be tabled when the new plan is tabled. I do not know whether this is the appropriate time to raise this issue—people who made submissions to the inquiry raised it as an issue—but I will raise it because it affects the independence of the ministerial council authority that will, as I understand it, be set up under the IGA. I am confused about the ministerial council. Will there now be one ministerial council or two?
