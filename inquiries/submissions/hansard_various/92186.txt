—The minister in the other place committed to the plan being prepared and finalised within two years. If it were in legislation, the whole scheme could potentially fall over because, due to extra consultation, the plan took two years and one day to put together. The government are firmly committed to this. It is interesting to note that sometimes the government are criticised for trying to rush this through—and I am not saying that you are necessarily asserting that, Senator Siewert—and, on other occasions, questions are asked about whether we would use the fact that it had not be legislated to drag our heels. No, we would not. We as a government are very much committed to this. It is our anticipation that everything will be in place within two years. But the view was that, if we were to legislate it and it took two years and one day, it would require further amendments et cetera and that would delay proceedings.
