                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 12:13 ):  It is not the only part of the bill or of the amendments in the chamber that seek to open up space. It is part of what I think you and I would consider quite technical reforms that do seek to open up space for a broader range of commercial agreements so we can meet our targets. Minister Plibersek has consistently said she would like all options to be on the table, including thinking more flexibly about how the Commonwealth might engage with willing sellers if they do wish to engage in transactions with the Commonwealth or indeed with states and territories in relation to the same kinds of environmental objectives.
