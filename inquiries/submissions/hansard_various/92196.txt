—First of all, in response to Senator O’Brien, the concern that the honourable senator raised was that a water access right holder who acted in accordance with their right could nonetheless act inconsistently with a basin plan. I understand that to have been his concern, and that has just been confirmed across the chamber. I can indicate to the honourable senator that this is not the purpose of the bill. I would like to assure the chamber that it is not intended to take any action under clause 35 against a water rights holder who acts in good faith and in accordance with the laws of the state and rights granted by the state in which the water is taken.

 
 In relation to Senator Siewert’s comments, I simply indicate that the whole drafting of this bill has been as a result of months and months of consultations, discussions and negotiations. In conclusion, I refer the honourable senator to the meaning of ‘water information’ in clause 125 and then also to clause 130, dealing with national water information standards, including 130(2)(j), ‘any other matter relating to water information that is specified in the regulations’. So if there is deemed to be a need to further enhance these things then that can in the future potentially be done by regulation. 
 Question negatived.
