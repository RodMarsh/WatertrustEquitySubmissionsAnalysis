â€”The clause as it stands is appropriate for the needs of the environmental water holder. It addresses the key limitation in state laws. The Commonwealth has taken the view that it should override state laws only to the extent absolutely necessary to achieve the objectives of the environmental water holder. Limitations on acquiring and using water are often imposed by state laws to achieve legitimate environmental outcomes and the Commonwealth does not wish to legislate to override such restrictions.
