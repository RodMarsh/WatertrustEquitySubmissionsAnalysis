                      ( New South Wales —Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 11:50 ):  For clarity—because I have an interpretation here—leased water will only count towards Basin Plan targets if an entitlement is transferred to the Commonwealth; is that correct? The entitlement has to be transferred to the Commonwealth, and that would have to be done before the 2027 deadline, if this goes through. I just want absolute certainty that, when the licence is retained by a water holder but a lease is entered into with the Commonwealth, that will come off water recovery targets for the period of time that the lease is held.
