                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:59 ):  Thanks, Senator Hanson. You point to an important feature of the way that the Murray-Darling system operates. You're right that states and territories are responsible for allocating water entitlements in each of the basin states. A core part of the Murray-Darling Basin process was to ask each of the states and territories to put in place what's called a sustainable diversion limit in each of the catchments within the basin and to ensure that there was a cap on the amount of water that could be extracted from that system for productive uses. This reflected the scientific advice about the ecological and environmental consequences of going beyond those caps. They also, of course, have economic consequences, because, in the end, if systems are overallocated, depending on the particular state, it can diminish the reliability of the entitlement that is held by some users in those systems. At the time that the Basin Plan was put in place, this was increasingly a problem in some states as a consequence of the mismatch between the licences that had been allocated and the water that was in fact available.
