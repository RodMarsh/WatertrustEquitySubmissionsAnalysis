â€”Believe me, at this time in the afternoon I am really trying hard not to be pedantic. Clauses 21(2) and (3) specifically take out articles from the Ramsar convention, and then the other one takes out clauses from the biodiversity convention. I am interpreting you as saying that, because there is reference to climate change and broad reference to international conventions, the climate change convention will be given effect through those clauses, even though it is not specifically referenced in one of the clauses. The advisers are nodding their heads. Is that correct?
