                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:20 ):  Thanks very much, Senator Davey. We will work through the specific format of the information that can be provided. Our broad objective is to ensure that progress is clear to the public and that the government and the basin states are generally held accountable for our progress in implementation. We don't intend to publish commercially sensitive information; that would be one of the constraints that we would observe. But we are yet to finalise the specific information that would be published. The broad objective, however, is to enhance transparency.
