â€”Section 255 makes it quite clear that the government, through the act, will not authorise compulsory acquisition of water rights. The reason for that is that, as part and parcel of our consultations over that seven-month period, there was a degree of opposition to that prospect. We also believe that that clause in the bill will provide integrity and security to water rights and will assist in the overall development of the markets in relation to water rights. That is why we came to that conclusion, and it is now in the legislation.
