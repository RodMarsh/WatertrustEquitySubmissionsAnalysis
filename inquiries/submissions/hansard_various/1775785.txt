                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 09:17 ):  I can confirm that the government has had discussions with the inspector-general about this question. That role, of course, is an independent role, and the way that the person in that role performs his duties as a matter for them. However, our expectation, based on those discussions, is that an audit of the kind that you describe is under contemplation, and the inspector-general intends to undertake an audit of this kind. The specific details about how they will perform that and the particular matters that they will contemplate as part of that are yet to be finalised.
