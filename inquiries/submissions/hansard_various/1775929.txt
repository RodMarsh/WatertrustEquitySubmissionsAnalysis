                      ( New South Wales â€” Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy ) ( 11:58 ):  As I was indicating to Senator Davey just now, we are interested in the broadest possible range of options. When the minister has said all options are on the table, as you noted in your question, she has made reference to different ways in which we might obtain water. It's part of the reason that the legislation before us does set out those criteria for how a particular option or commercial option might be evaluated. It needs to do certain things for the environment to be counted as a held environmental water entitlement.
