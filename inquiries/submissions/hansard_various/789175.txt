                      ( Hughes ) ( 09:58 ):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Water Amendment Bill 2015. As Dorothea Mackellar once said, we live in 'a sunburnt country', a land 'of drought and flooding rains'. That is why this water bill is important. We need to try to get the balance as right as we possibly can in this country. We will have at times in this country shortages of water and periods of drought, and at other times we will have periods of flood. The Water Amendment Bill gives effect to the government's commitment to legislate a cap on surface water purchases in the Murray-Darling Basin to 1,500 gigalitres. We hope that the opposition gets on board, and we also hope that the Greens get on board, because they need to realise how important the Murray-Darling Basin is to our Australian economy with the jobs and the wealth that it creates in our nation. 
                 
                 
                   Here are a few numbers. The Murray-Darling Basin—and these are the numbers from 2012 and 2013—accounted for over 50 per cent of Australia's irrigated produce, which included nearly 100 per cent of Australia's rice, 96 per cent of Australia's cotton, 75 per cent of our table grapes, 59 per cent of our hay, 54 per cent of our fruit, 52 per cent of the production of sheep and livestock and 45 per cent of our dairy. 
                 
                 
                   As other speakers have raised in this debate, there is an enormous opportunity in Australia if we are able to balance our water rights in the Murray-Darling Basin, because the potential that we have, through the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, to increase our agricultural exports is a once-in-a-century opportunity. We have seen China go through enormous change. We have seen them drop their communist and socialist policies and open up their markets, understanding that free markets are the way to lift people out of poverty and to raise prosperity for the nation. That is what they have done. They have gone through an enormous manufacturing cycle. In doing so they have raised the living standards, prosperity and wealth of that country. That gives us, here in Australia, an enormous opportunity to export to them, because it is true that Chinese citizens, the people who live in China, are prepared to pay a premium price for Australian produce. We have seen it where they have had the scares about their own products, like the melamine scare with the baby milk formula; that was just one of many scares that gives great faith in Chinese consumers paying a higher price for Australian produce. 
                 
                 
                   We need leaders in this country that have the vision and the foresight to see these once-in-a-century opportunities and to grab them with both hands, because that is where the future prosperity of our nation lies. So it gives me great disappointment, when I look back over the history of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, to see a quote from June 2005—over a decade ago, when the agreement was first being negotiated—of something said on  Meet the Press  by one Bill Shorten. This was his foresight about the future of agricultural exports. He said: 'What is it that we are going to sell to China in the future that we are not selling them now?' This is quite frankly an unbelievable comment. To think that someone would have such little vision that they could not see the potential of exports to China! To think that, back in 2005, they made such a bald-faced and ignorant comment as, 'What is it that we are going to sell to China in the future that we are not selling them now'! Well, I will tell you— 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       The DEPUTY SPEAKER  
                     
                     ( 
                     Mr Mitchell 
                     ):   If you could just wait a moment. The member for Fraser on a point of order? 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Dr Leigh: 
                       I know the member is a good wet in the party room, but he does seem to be straying a little from the substance of the water bill and I would ask you to ask him to return to the topic of the bill. 
                 
                 
                   
                     The DEPUTY SPEAKER:   I thank the member for Fraser. The member for Hughes is straying a little bit, but I know— 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr CRAIG KELLY: 
                       Mr Deputy Speaker, during this debate on the water bill, many other speakers have raised the China free trade agreement—the issues and the opportunities, and why it is important that the water bill gives opportunity on water, because it is water that creates the opportunity for these people to export and it is done. And this has been discussed quite extensively during other contributions to this debate. 
                 
                 
                   
                     Opposition members interjecting — 
                 
                 
                   
                     Mr McCormack interjecting — 
                 
                 
                   
                     The DEPUTY SPEAKER:   The Parliamentary Secretary might be a little bit excited, but just chill. I want to hear the member for Hughes. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr CRAIG KELLY: 
                       Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. You would think that any person in this country would understand the opportunities of the future in which we have to export. But we have an alternative Prime Minister of this country who, back in 2005 when the China free trade agreement was first put on the table, wondered, 'What else are we going to sell to them that we are not selling them now?' 
                 
                 
                   Well, I will give you a few examples to show how wrong the current Leader of the Opposition is. Let us take citrus, which mainly comes from the Murray-Darling region; back in 2005, we sold China zero citrus. Apart, perhaps, from a few Chinese tourists who snuck a few mandarins or a few tangelos or oranges or lemons in their backpack to take home with them on the plane, our exports to China of citrus fruit in 2005 were zero—a duck egg. The Leader of the Opposition asked, 'What else can we sell them?' Well, last year Australia sold to China $30 million worth of citrus product—from zero to $30 million—and that was made up of about $13 million worth of oranges, $8 million worth of mandarins and so on in other fruits. That is just the tip of the iceberg, because, once the China free trade agreement comes in, we will see a substantial reduction of tariffs on citrus fruit going into China. This is a golden opportunity. 
                 
                 
                   Here is another example—again, something that the Murray-Darling region produces a lot of: our table grapes and wine. Back in 2005, we sold to China $9.8 million worth of wine. The current Leader of the Opposition asked, 'What are we going to sell them in the future that we are not selling them now?' Well, from 2005 to today, Australia has increased our exports of wine from $9.8 million to $224 million. That is a 20-fold increase. Another $210 million of wine was exported from this country to China—that is the increase. And the current Leader of the Opposition thought, 'What else can we sell?'  
                 
                 
                   But that is only just the start. This is just the tip of the iceberg because, once the free trade agreement with China comes in, tariffs on Australian wine that are currently at 14 to 20 per cent—which, by the way, puts Australian exporters at a competitive disadvantage against New Zealand and Chile, who have much lower tariffs—will be reduced. So we have had that 20-fold increase, even though we have had that competitive disadvantage on the tariffs. Those tariffs of 14 per cent to 20 per cent are reduced to zero in four years—zero. These are the opportunities ahead. 
                 
                 
                   I will mention some of the other reductions. In the dairy industry we are seeing the elimination of a 15 per cent tariff on infant formula in Australia in four years; the elimination of the 10 to 19 per cent tariff on ice-cream lactose; the elimination of the 15 per cent tariff on liquid milk within nine years; and the elimination of the 10 to 20 per cent tariff on cheese, butter and yoghurt within nine years. This will create wealth, opportunities and tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of jobs in the Australian economy. And it goes on. The current tariff of 10 to 25 per cent on macadamia, almonds and walnuts goes down to zero within four years. We also see with all other fruit—mangoes, nectarines, cherries et cetera—the elimination of the current 10 to 13 per cent tariff within four years. It is the same for fresh vegetables, with the current tariff of 10 to 13 per cent going down to zero in four years. 
                 
                 
                   We produce some of the greatest quality products in the world. This is a once in a century golden opportunity for our nation to grab this free trade agreement—to have faith in our nation's exporters; to have faith in our people—and allow those exporters to get onto that Chinese playing field and compete at least on a level playing field if not with a competitive advantage against other countries. We have that opportunity but, sadly, this is all at risk from a union campaign that is not based on any factual information but is simply based— 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Dr Leigh: 
                       Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We all drink water. Water is ubiquitous in Australia. But that surely does not mean that the member can speak about anything in Australia that is touched by water. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       The DEPUTY SPEAKER  
                     
                     ( 
                     Mr Mitchell 
                     ):   I uphold the point of order and will ask the member for Hughes to contain his remarks in the remaining four minutes directly to the bill, please. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr CRAIG KELLY: 
                       Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: it is quite simple— 
                 
                 
                   
                     The DEPUTY SPEAKER:   No; I have ruled on the point of order. You have had a wide range. Just continue for the last few minutes on the bill. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr CRAIG KELLY: 
                       I will speak on the importance of water to the Murray-Darling Basin. It may be something that the member for Fraser does not understand, but you actually need water, Member for Fraser, to grow things. That is actually how it works. You have irrigation and you grow citrus fruit and other produce. That is how it works. I know that might be a unique concept for you, Member for Fraser. You may have difficulty in understanding the reason that we need to get this Water Act correct. 
                 
                 
                   
                     The DEPUTY SPEAKER:   The member for Hughes should direct his remarks through the chair. 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr CRAIG KELLY: 
                       Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Through you, of course, Deputy Speaker, I am trying to make the point to my good friend the member for Fraser that it must be realised that we need water to grow the crops. It is these crops and the livestock that come from that water that drive the wealth and prosperity of this country. If we are going to have increased allocations of water, we can take advantage of the export opportunities that are ahead for this nation. They are all related. You cannot separate the two. 
                 
                 
                   The water allocations and the need for that water are at risk because of an outrageous scare campaign that we are seeing from the unions. It is absolutely outrageous. I would have hoped that more members from the opposition would have stood up in this parliament to talk about the export opportunities that we have in the Murray-Darling Basin and talk about the importance of having the water allocations for those farmers and those growers—because that is where the future prosperity of this nation lies. But, instead, we have simply seen a disgraceful scare campaign that puts at risk those export opportunities for those growers who need that water in the Murray-Darling Basin. That is what we are seeing. 
                 
                 
                   It is a shameful part of our politics in Australia today that we cannot get bipartisan support for this. I would have thought that good members on the other side of the parliament—such as the member for Fraser—would have given this bipartisan support. I am sure he understands the importance of getting this free trade agreement through so that we can give opportunities to these growers. With that, I commend this bill to the House, but I would finally say in conclusion— 
                 
                 
                   
                     Dr Leigh interjecting — 
                 
                 
                   
                     
                       Mr CRAIG KELLY: 
                       I know the member for Fraser might think this is funny and that this is a joke. But, for those Australians who are out there working long hours on the land—from sunrise to sunset—and are relying on this parliament to do the right thing by them and to open up those opportunities, I call on members of the opposition to have a thought for them and to do the right thing and get behind not only this legislation but also the China free trade agreement.
