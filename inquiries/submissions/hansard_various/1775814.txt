                      ( Queensland — Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation ) ( 09:42 ):  This is basically about water buyback and the 450 gigalitres, plus I see you want another 315 gigalitres in approximately 700 gigalitres to buy back, which is equivalent to—just for the public to know—about 1½ times what is in Sydney Harbour. That's the amount of water you want to take out of communities from irrigators. What's more important in Australia to this government? Is it to the farming sector, who require the water to grow their produce to feed Australians and to export, or is it the environment? What's your priority?
