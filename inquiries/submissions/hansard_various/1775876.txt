                      ( Queensland ) ( 11:01 ):  Premier Minns in New South Wales has publicly stated that the New South Wales government is only signing off on water buybacks until all the SDLAM projects have been completed, and the Premier specifically set 2026 as being the deadline for non-buyback measures. Will the government be conducting buybacks in New South Wales, against the wishes of the New South Wales Premier?
