                      ( New South Wales â€”Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) ( 12:10 ):  So an interesting concept, and I'm trying to work it through in my brain. If I was a water entitlement holder or a water right holder and I wanted to sell the Commonwealth part, say, 20 per cent, given the way that water access rights or water licences then get allocated, which 20 per cent of the allocation or the access would it be? Would it be the first 20 per cent, the last 20 per cent? It is very ambiguous. People who are looking at this for guidance, particularly when it comes to participating in a voluntary water purchase, will want to understand what it means.
