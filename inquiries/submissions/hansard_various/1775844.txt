                      ( Victoria — Leader of the Nationals in the Senate ) ( 10:15 ):  Minister, when a bill comes before the parliament, usually you will have done an impact assessment. My question remains: what analysis has the government done to assess the impact of removing 450 gigalitres additional to the plan—because that was never part of the plan—and removing the socioeconomic detriment test? What is your understanding, as you stand here today? I ask that because I'm hearing from people who are saying that jobs will be lost, businesses will go out of town, dairy production will fall and there will be impacts on food manufacturers, such as SPC in Shepparton, Saputo in Cobram, the Tatura Milk factory, that employ hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people. When dad or mum loses their job, that has significant social impacts in these communities. I have heard your answer. I asked a very simple question: what analysis has your government done to understand the economic impact of the legislation that we are debating on affected communities and, in particular, on the dairy industry? You haven't answered the question.
