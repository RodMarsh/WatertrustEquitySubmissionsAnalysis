                      ( Queensland ) ( 11:06 ):  Minister, many people will be affected by this bill: farmers, families, rural businesses, communities, whole regions, whole statesâ€”our whole nation. This bill is so irresponsible. The trademarks of your government in the last 18 months have been a lack of consultation, contrary to what opposition leader Anthony Albanese promised in his election campaign; and a large number of ill-conceived amendments, reflecting a dodgy deal with the Greens that compromises the people's interest, and which shows a lack of understanding, shows repeated contradictions of science and shows repeated contradictions of empirical evidence. Labor is now in coalition with the Greens, culminating in a joint press conference between Senator Sarah Hanson-Young and Minister Plibersek on Monday. Will Senator Hanson-Young be given a ministerial portfolio? And what is the basis of Labor's deal with the Greens that enables passage of this hideous bill?
