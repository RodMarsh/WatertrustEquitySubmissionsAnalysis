                    ( South Australia ) ( 16:28 ):  I move: 
               
               
                 That the Senate— 
               
               
                 (a) notes that: 
               
               
                 (i) the Murray-Darling Basin Plan (the Plan) has come under serious scrutiny from both the South Australian Royal Commission and the recent inquiry by the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, and 
               
               
                 (ii) the Plan has no provisions to address the impacts of climate change on the Murray­ Darling Basin; and 
               
               
                 (b) calls on the Federal Government to take the threat of climate change seriously, and include the impacts of climate change within the Plan. 
               
               
                 
                   The PRESIDENT:   Before I move on to Senator Ruston, I'm going to remind senators to not try and creep matters for debate, which has crept in over the course of the last week or two, into reading out their notices of motion. This is getting very lengthy. Senator Ruston, you are seeking leave to make a short statement, and leave is granted for one minute.
