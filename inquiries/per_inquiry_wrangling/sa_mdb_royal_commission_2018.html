In summary because planning is an inferior way of dealing with uncertainty compared with an incremental or experimental forward-looking approach. The idea that social, economic and environmental outcomes can be optimised without assigning arbitrary weights is unachievable.</li><li>The BP might be thought of as a backdoor way of reducing the existing Cap on diversions from the MDB. But the Basin Plan is an expensive and indirect way of going about an objective that should be dealt with on other criteria. Past arrangements were working satisfactorily an only required rejigging and more resources. By exacerbating interstate tensions, the BP puts those achievements at risk.</li><li>The most damaging economic and fiscal aspect of the BP is the dominant position of public expenditure on off-farm and on-farm irrigation infrastructure. Surprised the PC review has not highlighted.</li><li>he interests of the few prevail. No Basin state is blameless. The Commonwealth Government does not have the technical expertise of the states whatever its financial power. The situation is not helped by the long-term marginalisation of the central agencies from the water debate.</li><li>The genesis and development of the Plan has made the politics and administrative arrangements of the MDB more tortuous. Water theft is not the fault of the B, it has reduced public confidence. The BP is often a scapegoat.</li><li>By the 1980s and 90s irrigation in the MDB was approaching its hydrological, environmental and economic limits because the best sites for dams were developed and water extractions for irrigation were approaching sustainable limits compromising downstream user, including other irrigators. In fact policies were emerging on a project-by-project basis to deal with environmental issues under existing administrative arrangements (Cap 1995, Floodplain wetland management strategy 1998, TLM 2000).</li><li>Two recurrent themes muddy popular discussion of water and environmental policy for the MDB. First, the pre-occupation with the commodities produced on irrigated farms – what is grown on farms is a decision best left to farmers. Irrigation water has to fit into farming systems not the other way around. Second, ahistorical claims about the estuarine status of the lower Lakes and Murray Mouth with the confident and unproductive suggestion that the barrages be removed and the Lower Lakes flooded.</li><li>The development of the BP could be interpreted as rewriting the existing water sharing agreement between the states in favour of SA. The existing cap on water extractions form the MDB has been revised upwards by calculating new SDL. Increasing the cap to allow more water for the Lower Lakes and at the Murray Mouth might be justified on other criteria. The lengthy and costly procedures of the BP were an expensive way of approaching the issue.</li><li>Irrigation development in Australia was not based on rational calculation. It is proving difficult to exercise rational decision making now that irrigation in the MDB has entered an overdue contraction phase.</li><li>The most contentious aspect of the Basin Plan is its emphasis on public investment in off-farm and on-farm irrigation infrastructure to deliver water savings to increase flows for environmental benefit within the MDB.</li><li>Water savings in the Connections Project in the Goulburn valley will cost $10,000/ML on completion – around five times the price for water entitlements. This is a high price to pay for the improved service and labour savings enjoyed by irrigators connected to this modernised irrigation network.</li><li>Subsidised investment discriminates against irrigation industries (and regions) that have already adopted modern methods of irrigation compared with industries where new techniques are being developed. What is the justification for irrigated farmers having their capital requirements subsidised when other farmers, and small business generally pay their own way. The same goes for off-farm irrigation infrastructure. Other farmers meet the costs of industry specific infrastructure essential to the conduct of their businesses – grain handling and meat processing facilities.</li><li>One irrigators return flows is another irrigators irrigation entitlement or contributes to environmental flows.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td height="40" width="511"><a title="Submission to Murray Darling Basin Royal Commission, Andrew Kelly, West Corurgan Private Irrigation - NSW" href="https://cdn.environment.sa.gov.au/environment/docs/andrew-kelly-west-corurgan-provate-irrigation-nsw-mdb-rc-gen.pdf">Andrew Kelly</a><br>West Corurgan Private Irrigation District</td><td width="928"><ul><li>Concerned about the Coorong and the Murray Mouth</li><li>West Corurgan disadvantaged by current water buying system which limits our ability to secure permanent water – outbid by corporations paying inflated prices</li><li>Concerned about long-term viability of agricultural industries and small communities within West Corurgan Private Irrigation District.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td height="20" width="511"><a title="Submission to Murray Darling Basin Royal Commission, Andrew Sniedze - SA" href="https://cdn.environment.sa.gov.au/environment/docs/andrew-sniedze-sa-mdb-rc-gen.pdf">Andrew Sneidze, SA</a></td><td width="928"><ul><li>Suggestion of a ‘Plan B’ for the Coorong to replace Murray Mouth dredging – opening a series of pipelines between the Coorong and the ocean</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td height="20" width="511"><a title="Submission to Murray Darling Basin Royal Commission, Anna Hooper - Australian Vignerons - SA" href="https://cdn.environment.sa.gov.au/environment/docs/anna-hooper-australian-vignerons-sa-mdb-rc-gen.pdf">Anna Hooper</a><br>Acting CEO, Australian Vignerons, SA</td><td width="928"><ul><li>Basin Plan must seek to provide a level of certainty for irrigators</li><li>Supports the application of Sustainable Diversion limits (SDLs) on the volumes of water for irrigation allocation in catchments – provided that the application of the SDL is based on rigorous scientific assessment that is open to review by industry and the community</li><li>Supports the provision of a reasonable transition period to allow industry to adapt to any changes in SDLs – however, no support for any additional removal of water from irrigators taking place prior to a comprehensive assessment and reconciliation of the 36 supply measures and the completion of the Northern Basin Review</li><li>Any further increases to SDLs should only be made once adequate water for the environment has been made available and once the outcomes of the programs have been quantified and proven</li><li>Economic and social factors should be considered when determining how and over what time period the Basin Plan sets out to meet the ESLT</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td height="40" width="511"><a title="Submission to Murray Darling Basin Royal Commission, Anne Reeves, Inland Rivers Network - NSW" href="https://cdn.environment.sa.gov.au/environment/docs/anne-reeves-inland-rivers-network-nsw-mdb-rc-gen.pdf">Anne Reeves</a><br>Inland Rivers Network, NSW</td><td width="928"><ul><li>Process to determine ESLT: Concerns over discrepancies in the initial Guide and the Final basin plan over planned environmental water and final ESLT determination.

However CA does recognise that the Supply measures and the Northern Basin Review do form an integral part of delivering the Basin Plan in full, and therefore the 450Gl upwater is part of the Plan.</li><li>On-farm irrigation efficiency projects may be one way of meeting this requirement, but serious consideration must be given to a wider range of recovery mechanisms.</li><li>CA concerned that the Basin Plan and (CEWH) singular focus on holding water entitlements as the only way to meet the environmental water requirements.</li><li>Cotton Australia believes that CEWH, like a modern irrigator, needs to be a nimble trader of water assets.</li><li>Should explore whether other water products would assist the CEWH in meeting their requirements in the most efficient way possible should be adopted. While also allowing where appropriate, the use of environmental water for extractive use; with the proceeds being invested into environmental outcomes.</li><li>Efficiency measures – also without doubt is that these programmes offer long-term benefits to the communities that they are offered. This is borne out by the MDBA social and economic assessment work that was carried out as part of the Northern Basin review. The Goondiwindi area, where the majority of water recovery has been achieved through efficiency programs, was the only area that saw employment growth through the implementation of the Basin Plan.</li><li>Cotton Australia is aware of no efficiency or recovery project where there is any risk of the Commonwealth no receiving its agreed level of entitlement. In fact the risk lays entirely with irrigator, because whether the estimated savings are achieved or not, the irrigators must hand over the agreed level of entitlement.</li></ul><p><strong>Structural Adjustment Assistance</strong></p><ul><li>It is CA’s view that while individual irrigators have been largely free to engage or not, in the trading of entitlements to the Commonwealth, it is the communities that have suffered most form the Basin Plan. All irrigation dependent communities across the Basin, have lost either actual economic activity or potential economic activity from the Commonwealth water acquisition program. The Commonwealth’s support for these communities through the Murray-Darling Basin Regional Economic Diversification program has been completely inadequate by any measure. According to the Productivity Commission’s discussion paper just $73 million (0.73%) of a $10 Billion MDB Plan has been committed to these communities. Unfortunately, a significant proportion of this inadequate funding was directed to projects in communities that while they have been located in the Basin, were not irrigation dependant. While other communities have lost significant jobs and population because of the Basin Plan have received nothing. Cotton Australia strongly recommends that the Commission seek additional and effective diversification funding for these communities.</li></ul><p><strong>Environmental Water Planning and Management</strong></p><ul><li>CA has long been concerned about what appears to be a strong presence of duplication between the MDBA and the CEWH, when it comes to setting environmental watering priorities. CA contends that while the MDBA has had the role of determining how much water should be available to the environment. The CEWH should have responsibility of determining how the Commonwealth owned water is managed. CA also believes that the efficient management of environmental water by the CEWH can only be achieved when management is done in full co-operation with other holders and managers of environmental water. CA believes that the CEWH and other managers of environmental water have a responsibility to clearly communicate to communities prior to, during and after environmental releases. The purposed/expected environmental outcome from a release should be specifically communicated. Progress to achieving the specific outcome/s should be communicated and the actual outcomes should be objectively measured and reported on. Simply setting targets of trying to achieve certain hydrological results is simply not acceptable. Targets must relate to specific environmental outcomes.</li></ul><p><strong>Water Trade</strong></p><ul><li>CA is concerned that there does appear to be at times a tendency to try to ‘over develop’ or ‘over sophisticate’ the market.</li><li>CA suggests that government jurisdictions still do more to improve the speed of transfers, allowing closer realisation of a ‘real time’ market. For water market information provided by private providers to be truly effective they need access to all trades and this in reality can only be achieved through access to real-time (or near to real time water registers).</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td height="20" width="511">Cr Mark Eckel<br>Mildura Rural City Council, VIC</td><td width="928"><ul><li>Response to the Terms of Reference</li><li>The need for the maximised use of environmental water for the protection and restoration of environmental assets needs to be considered in conjunction with the political environment which competitively seeks to maximise consumptive use</li><li>Needs to be an increased level of public reporting, on the evaluation and outcomes of the use of water, readily available to the community – need for increased transparency and greater public confidence in the system</li><li>Proposals put forward for use of environmental water or SDL associated projects should not be considered or undertaken without accessible scientific evidence – a rigorous process is required in the development and accountability of projects and the associated environmental impacts and benefits</li><li>Various concerns as to the management of the Darling River and Menindee Lakes storage</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td height="20" width="511">Cr Phillip O’Conner<br>Mayor, Brewarrina Shire Council, NSW</td><td width="928"><ul><li>With regards to irrigators and allocation of water – concerns about clear lack of transparency and no system for declaring obvious pecuniary interests – a few large operators are illegally pumping with apparent immunity</li><li>View of the Council is that the Basin Plan has decreased the water security of the Brewarrina Community – most devastating impacts have been the sale and activation of water licenses, the transfer for licences away from properties, the removal of pump size restrictions on ‘A’ class licenses, and the failure to protect environmental flows</li><li>Concerns about unregulated river pumping during low flow events</li><li>Allegations of water theft</li><li>Recommends better measures for metering, monitoring, and compliance</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td height="20" width="511"><p><a title="Submission to Murray Darling Basin Royal Commission, Dr Peter Mayfield -
